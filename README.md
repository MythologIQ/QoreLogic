---

## 🚀 Quick Start (Zero-Setup)

**QoreLogic Gatekeeper** is now a fully isolated, sovereign appliance. You do not need to install Python or dependencies on your host machine.

### 1. Launch the System

Navigate to the `launcher` directory and double-click:

> **`Launch_QoreLogic.bat`**

This will open the **Command Center**, where you can:

- **Initialize** the sovereign Docker engine (runs continuously).
- **Create & Switch** isolated workspaces instantly without restarting.
- **Audit** multiple projects with strict data segregation.

### 2. CLI Usage

Once initialized, you can use the generated wrapper in your project:

```powershell
.\qorelogic-check.bat --monitor src/my_code.py
```
