# QoreLogic Research Laboratory

This directory contains the active research artifacts, data tables, and study protocols for the QoreLogic project.

## Directory Structure

### 1. `studies/` (Active Protocols)

Formal definitions of the ongoing research investigations.

- `STUDY_001_SENTINEL.md`: Formal Verification viability.
- `STUDY_002_JUDGE_MCP.md`: MCP Enforcement architecture.
- `STUDY_003_EFFICIENCY.md`: HRM vs. CoT cost analysis.

### 2. `data/` (The Atlas)

Raw data, benchmarks, and reference tables.

- `DATA_ATLAS.md`: Safety benchmarks, tool lists, and HRM stats.

### 3. `process/` (Methodology)

The rules of engagement for the research itself.

- `REVIEW_LIFECYCLE.md`: The Recursive ("Fail Forward") verification flow.

## Research Philosophy

**Fail Forward:** We prioritize the identification and archival of failure modes (The Shadow Genome) over the immediate production of features.
