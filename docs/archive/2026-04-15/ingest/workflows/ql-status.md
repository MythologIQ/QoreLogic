# /ql-status - Quick Lifecycle Check

</skill>

## Purpose

Quick, low-token diagnostic of project health. Read-minimal by design.

## Execution (Decision Tree)

### Step 1: Existence Checks Only

```
Glob: docs/META_LEDGER.md     -> has_ledger
Glob: docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md -> has_plan
Glob: .agent/staging/AUDIT_REPORT.md -> has_audit
```

**Do NOT read file contents yet.**

### Step 2: Determine State

```
IF !has_ledger:
  STATE = "UNINITIALIZED"
  NEXT = "/ql-bootstrap (first-time workspace setup only)"
  DONE (output immediately)

IF !has_plan:
  STATE = "SECURE INTENT"
  NEXT = "Create ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md OR use /ql-plan for new feature"
  DONE

IF !has_audit:
  # Only now read first 15 lines for Risk Grade
  Read: docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md (limit: 15)
  Extract: "Risk Grade: L[1-3]"

  IF L2 or L3:
    STATE = "GATED"
    NEXT = "/ql-audit"
  ELSE:
    STATE = "READY"
    NEXT = "/ql-implement"
  DONE

IF has_audit:
  # Read first 10 lines for verdict
  Read: .agent/staging/AUDIT_REPORT.md (limit: 10)

  IF contains "PASS":
    STATE = "IMPLEMENTING"
    NEXT = "Continue work, /ql-plan for new feature, or /ql-substantiate when done"
  ELSE IF contains "VETO":
    STATE = "BLOCKED"
    NEXT = "Address audit findings, re-run /ql-audit"
  DONE
```

### Important: New Feature vs New Workspace

| Scenario                           | Command                  | Description                                             |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **New workspace** (no META_LEDGER) | `/ql-bootstrap`          | Initialize DNA, CONCEPT, ARCHITECTURE_PLAN, META_LEDGER |
| **New feature** (workspace exists) | `/ql-plan`               | Create plan-\*.md with phases, affected files, tests    |
| **Resume work** (audit exists)     | Continue or `/ql-status` | Check current state and next action                     |

**Note**: `/ql-bootstrap` is for **workspace initialization only**. For planning new features in an existing workspace, use `/ql-plan`.

### Step 3: Chain Spot-Check (Optional)

Only if user requests integrity check:

```
Read: docs/META_LEDGER.md (last 30 lines only via offset)
Check: Last entry has SHA256 hash format
Report: "Chain: OK" or "Chain: Verify with /ql-validate"
```

Full verification deferred to `/ql-validate`.

### Step 4: Output

```markdown
## Status: [STATE]

| Check  | Result              |
| ------ | ------------------- |
| Ledger | [exists/missing]    |
| Plan   | [exists/missing]    |
| Audit  | [PASS/VETO/pending] |
| Chain  | [OK/unverified]     |

**Next**: [NEXT]
```

## Token Budget

- Skill load: ~1.5KB
- Max additional reads: <3KB
- Target total: <5KB context impact

## Constraints

- **NEVER** load persona files (identity is implicit)
- **NEVER** read entire files when partial suffices
- **NEVER** enumerate src/\*_/_
- **ALWAYS** use existence checks before content reads
- **ALWAYS** stop at first determination (short-circuit)

_Full verification: /ql-validate | Full details: ask for expanded status_
