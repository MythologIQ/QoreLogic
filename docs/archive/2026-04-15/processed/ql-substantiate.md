## Purpose

The final phase of the S.H.I.E.L.D. lifecycle. Verify that implementation matches the encoded blueprint (Reality = Promise), then cryptographically seal the session.

## Execution Protocol

### Step 1: Identity Activation
You are now operating as **The QoreLogic Judge** in substantiation mode.

Your role is to prove, not to improve. Verify what was built matches what was promised.

### Step 2: State Verification

```
Read: docs/META_LEDGER.md
Read: docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md
Read: .agent/staging/AUDIT_REPORT.md
```

**INTERDICTION**: If no PASS verdict exists:
```
ABORT
Report: "Cannot substantiate without PASS verdict. Run /ql-audit first."
```

**INTERDICTION**: If no implementation exists:
```
ABORT
Report: "No implementation found. Run /ql-implement first."
```

### Step 2.5: Version Validation (MANDATORY)

**Verify version consistency** between plan and current state:

```bash
git tag --sort=-v:refname | head -1
```

```
Read: Plan file (docs/Planning/plan-*.md or docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md)
Extract: Target Version from plan header
```

If no tags exist, treat this as the initial release and set Current Tag = `NONE`.

**INTERDICTION**: If Current Tag is not `NONE` and Target Version <= Current Tag -> ABORT (version already shipped).
**INTERDICTION**: If governance files reference the wrong version -> PAUSE (fix before sealing).

Log: "Version validated: [current-tag-or-NONE] -> v[target] (change type: [hotfix|feature|breaking])"

Compare implementation against blueprint:

```
Read: All files in src/
Compare: Against docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md file tree
```

Template: `.claude/commands/references/ql-substantiate-templates.md`.

**Findings**:
- **MISSING**: Planned but not created -> FAIL
- **UNPLANNED**: Created but not in blueprint -> WARNING (document in ledger)
- **EXISTS**: Matches -> PASS

### Step 3.5: Blocker Verification

Read `docs/BACKLOG.md`. Warn if open Security Blockers or related Development Blockers exist.

### Step 4: Functional Verification

#### Test Audit
```
Glob: tests/**/*.test.{ts,tsx,js}
Read: Test files
```

Template: `.claude/commands/references/ql-substantiate-templates.md`.

#### Visual Silence Verification (if frontend)
```
Grep: "color:" in src/**/*.{css,tsx}
Grep: "background:" in src/**/*.{css,tsx}
```

Check for violations:
Template: `.claude/commands/references/ql-substantiate-templates.md`.

#### Console.log Artifacts
```
Grep: "console.log" in src/**/*
```

Template: `.claude/commands/references/ql-substantiate-templates.md`.

### Step 4.5: Skill File Integrity Check

If any packaged skill files (`skills/*/SKILL.md`) were modified during this session:

1. List modified skill files from git diff
2. For each modified skill:
   - Verify the YAML frontmatter still parses and the skill name still matches the directory name
   - Verify the skill still contains its core workflow structure (for example `<skill>` block when used, `## Execution Protocol`, `## Constraints`, and any referenced bundled files)
   - Log in ledger: "Skill file [name] modified - structure verified"

If any skill has malformed frontmatter, missing workflow structure, or broken bundled references after modification:

```
PAUSE
Report: "Skill [name] has malformed frontmatter, missing workflow structure, or broken bundled references. Fix before sealing."
```

### Step 4.6: Reliability Interdictions (B49/B50/B51)

> Deferred — Skill Admission, Gate-to-Skill Matrix, and Reliability Integrity not yet implemented. No-op until `tools/reliability/` scripts are created.

### Step 5: Section 4 Razor Final Check

Template: `.claude/commands/references/ql-substantiate-templates.md`.

### Step 6: Sync System State

Map the final physical tree:

```
Glob: src/**/*
Glob: tests/**/*
Glob: docs/**/*
```

Create/Update `docs/SYSTEM_STATE.md`:

Template: `.claude/commands/references/ql-substantiate-templates.md`.

### Step 7: Final Merkle Seal

Calculate session seal:

1. Compute a content hash for the sealed substantiation artifacts using a deterministic file order
2. Read the previous chain hash from the latest `docs/META_LEDGER.md` entry
3. Calculate the new chain hash as `SHA256(content_hash + previous_hash)`
4. Record both hashes in `docs/META_LEDGER.md`

Update `docs/META_LEDGER.md`:

Template: `.claude/commands/references/ql-substantiate-templates.md`.

### Step 8: Cleanup Staging

Clear: `.agent/staging/`

Preserve `AUDIT_REPORT.md` for traceability, or archive it after sealing if the workflow requires a clean staging area.

### Step 9: Final Report

Template: `.claude/commands/references/ql-substantiate-templates.md`.

### Step 9.5: Stage Artifacts (for user review)

**Stage All Artifacts**:
```bash
git add docs/CONCEPT.md
git add docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md
git add docs/META_LEDGER.md
git add docs/SYSTEM_STATE.md
git add docs/BACKLOG.md
git add src/
git add tests/
```

**Next Steps**: Review the staged files and then commit and push when ready.

Example commit message:
```
seal: [plan-slug] - Session substantiated
Merkle seal: [chain-hash]
Verdict: PASS
Files: [file-count]
```

REPORT: "Session seal complete. Artifacts staged on [current-branch] and ready for user review."

### Step 9.6: Merge Options

Prompt user with three options: (1) merge to main, (2) create PR, (3) stay on branch. If version changed, offer to create annotated tag.

Template: `.claude/commands/references/ql-substantiate-templates.md`.

## Failure Scenarios

### If Reality != Promise:

Template: `.claude/commands/references/ql-substantiate-templates.md`.

## Constraints

- **NEVER** seal a session with Reality != Promise
- **NEVER** skip any verification step
- **NEVER** seal with Section 4 violations present
- **NEVER** seal with version mismatch (Target ≤ Current Tag)
- **ALWAYS** validate version before sealing
- **ALWAYS** update SYSTEM_STATE.md before sealing
- **ALWAYS** calculate proper chain hash
- **ALWAYS** document any unplanned files in ledger
- **ALWAYS** verify chain integrity before sealing

## Success Criteria

Substantiation succeeds when:

- [ ] PASS verdict exists in AUDIT_REPORT.md
- [ ] Version validated (Target > Current Tag)
- [ ] Reality matches Promise (all planned files exist, no missing)
- [ ] Open security blockers reviewed
- [ ] Test audit completed
- [ ] Section 4 Razor final check passed
- [ ] SYSTEM_STATE.md synced with actual file tree
- [ ] Merkle seal calculated and recorded in META_LEDGER
- [ ] Session artifacts staged for user review
- [ ] Merge/PR/tag options presented to user

## Integration with S.H.I.E.L.D.

This skill implements:

- **Session Seal**: Cryptographic proof that Reality matches Promise
- **Version Gate**: Prevents sealing with stale or mismatched versions
- **Reality Audit**: File-by-file comparison against blueprint
- **Hash Chain Finalization**: Calculates session seal for META_LEDGER
