# QoreLogic Sovereign Fortress

## Introduction

**QoreLogic** is a **recursive governance system** for AI agents. It ensures that autonomous agents operate within strict, verifiable boundaries through cryptographic identity, trust dynamics, and formal verification.

## Core Pillars

1.  **Sovereign Identity**: Ed25519-based agent identities controlled locally.
2.  **Trust Dynamics**: Math-based reputation (SCI, EigenTrust) that decays over time.
3.  **Formal Verification**: Multi-tier checking (Static -> DbC -> Formal) to prevent hallucinations.
4.  **Fail Forward**: Using failures (Shadow Genome) to immunize the system.
