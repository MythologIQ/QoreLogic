# Qor-logic System State

**Snapshot**: 2026-05-01
**Chain Status**: ACTIVE (Phase 55 feature sealing at v0.41.0 — Cedar-enforced subagent admission + model-pinning + CycloneDX SBOM + pre-audit lints + deliver schema)
**Phase**: Phase 55 sealed (feature). Third phase of a five-phase compliance sprint per `docs/research-brief-prompt-logic-frameworks-2026-04-30.md`. Closes Priority 3 (subagent least-privilege + model-pinning) plus the recurring-pattern advisory from Phase 53/54 audits via pre-audit lints. New `qor/policies/skill_admission.cedar` extended with two `forbid` rules over `actual_tool_invocations_exceed_scope` and `actual_subagent_invocations_exceed_scope`. New `compute_skill_admission_attributes` in `qor/policy/resource_attributes.py` with `_CANONICAL_TOOLS` frozenset (10 Tool names). 8 scoped skills declare `model_compatibility` + `min_model_capability` from ordered `(haiku, sonnet, opus)` tier set. New `qor/scripts/model_pinning_lint.py` (~135 LOC) wired at `/qor-plan` Step 0.3 (WARN-only). New CycloneDX v1.5 SBOM emitter `qor/scripts/sbom_emit.py` (~145 LOC, hand-rolled stdlib, zero new runtime deps); `qor-logic release sbom` CLI registered via new `qor/cli_handlers/release.py`. **`qor/gates/schema/deliver.schema.json` declared NEW** (closes long-standing surface gap where `qor-repo-release` wrote `phase="deliver"` artifacts that bypassed schema validation; `validate_gate_artifact.PHASES` extended with `"deliver"`). New `qor/scripts/plan_test_lint.py` + `plan_grep_lint.py` (pre-audit lints catching presence-only test descriptions and infrastructure-mismatch citations) wired at `/qor-audit` Step 0.6 + `/qor-repo-audit` Step 0.6 (WARN-only). SG-PreAuditLintGap-A appended to countermeasures doctrine documenting the cross-session recurring pattern. `qor/scripts/sprint_progress.py` extended with `sealed_priorities_from_ledger` that walks SESSION SEAL entries and recognizes "Bundles Priorities N, M, ..." patterns. 1104 tests passing twice in a row (deterministic, +67 from Phase 54). 3 new glossary terms (tool-scope policy, model-pinning frontmatter, CycloneDX SBOM). Sprint state: 5/5 priorities sealed post-Phase-55-seal. Previous phase -- Phase 54 sealed (feature). Second phase of a five-phase compliance sprint per `docs/research-brief-prompt-logic-frameworks-2026-04-30.md`. Closes Priorities 2 (AI provenance + AI Act/RMF doctrines + machine-readable transparency), 4 (path-currency cleanup folded earlier into Phase 53), and 5 (override-friction escalator). Bundles three priorities into one feature phase to reduce ceremony cost. New `qor/gates/schema/_provenance.schema.json` `$ref`'d from all six phase schemas declaring `{system, version, host, model_family, human_oversight, ts}`. New `qor/scripts/ai_provenance.py` (~140 LOC) with `build_manifest` + `HumanOversight` enum (`pass | veto | override | absent`); auto-derives `version` from `pyproject.toml`, `host` from `qor.scripts.qor_platform.current()`, `model_family` from `QOR_MODEL_FAMILY` env; warning suppressible via `QOR_PROVENANCE_QUIET=1`. CLI subcommand-handler split: NEW `qor/cli_handlers/{__init__,compliance.py}` (~110 LOC) hosts extracted `do_report` plus new `do_ai_provenance` and `do_sprint_progress`; `qor/cli.py` 227 LOC -> 186 LOC. `qor.scripts.validate_gate_artifact` extended with `referencing.Registry` to resolve cross-schema `$ref`. New doctrines: `doctrine-eu-ai-act.md` (Art. 9/10/12/13/14/15/50/72 mapping; Annex IV guidance; applicability classification asserts Qor-logic is *not* high-risk per Annex III) + `doctrine-ai-rmf.md` (GOVERN/MAP/MEASURE/MANAGE + AI 600-1 GenAI Profile §2.4/§2.7/§2.8/§2.10/§2.12). Plan schema `impact_assessment` block (5 required subfields when `high_risk_target: true`); new Step 1c "Impact assessment dialogue" in `/qor-plan`. `permitted_tools` + `permitted_subagents` advisory frontmatter on 6 SDLC + governance skills (declarative-only this phase; Phase 55 wires Cedar enforcement). New `qor/scripts/override_friction.py` (~80 LOC) with `OverrideFrictionRequired` exception (threshold = 3, symmetric with cycle-count escalator); `gate_chain.emit_gate_override` consults the friction module; 7 override-emitting skills handle the exception. `shadow_event.schema.json` `justification` field (minLength 50). Doctrine §12 added to `doctrine-governance-enforcement.md`. New `qor/scripts/sprint_progress.py` + `qor-logic compliance sprint-progress` CLI (reads latest research brief, walks ledger, emits per-Priority status). 1037 tests passing twice in a row (deterministic, +90 from Phase 53). 4 new glossary terms (AI provenance manifest, human-oversight signal, subagent tool scope, override-friction escalator). Self-application: this implement gate carries the first `ai_provenance` field in repo history (`{system: Qor-logic, version: 0.39.0, host: unknown, model_family: unknown, human_oversight: absent}`). Phase 53 historical fix landed mid-implement: seal commit amended (operator-authorized) to add canonical attribution trailer; tag `v0.39.0` recreated at new SHA; Merkle seal in Entry #174 unaffected. Sprint roadmap: Phases 55 (Cedar-enforced subagent admission + model-pinning + SBOM) and 56 (secret-scanning gate at substantiate) queued. Previous phase -- Phase 53 sealed (feature). First phase of a five-phase compliance sprint per `docs/research-brief-prompt-logic-frameworks-2026-04-30.md`. Closes OWASP LLM Top 10 (2025) **LLM01 Prompt Injection** (HIGH) at the audit-prose layer for operator-authored governance markdown surface; aligns with NIST AI 600-1 §2.7 and EU AI Act Art. 15 cybersecurity dimension. New `qor/scripts/prompt_injection_canaries.py` (frozen six-class catalog: instruction-redirect, role-redefinition, pass-coercion, meta-override, unicode-directionality, hidden-html); `scan(content)` API; argv-form CLI with `--mask-code-blocks` flag for documentation scanning. `/qor-audit` Step 3 Prompt Injection Pass runs before Security Pass; commit-time complement via fifth `forbid` rule on `Code::"governance"` resources in `qor/policies/owasp_enforcement.cedar`. New `qor/policy/resource_attributes.py` (`compute_governance_attributes`, `is_governance_path`) is the caller-side helper; evaluator unchanged. New doctrine `qor/references/doctrine-prompt-injection.md`. SG-PromptInjection-A appended to countermeasures. `prompt-injection` added to `findings_categories` enum. **OWASP (2021) LOW-4 closed**: `qor/reliability/intent_lock.py:_audit_has_pass` regex tightened from substring `re.search VERDICT.*PASS` to multiline-anchored canonical-line form. After Phase 53: zero residual OWASP (2021) MEDIUM/LOW findings open. **DRIFT-1 + DRIFT-2 closed**: full skill+agent tree sweep cleared `.failsafe/governance/` and `memory/failsafe-bridge.md` legacy references (4 skill files + 5 agent files). 30 source files touched; 947 tests passing twice in a row (deterministic, +37 from Phase 52). Three new glossary terms (prompt-injection canary, untrusted-data quarantine, instruction-anchor regex). Self-application Phase 4 verified: plan + brief + doctrine all scan clean once code-block masking is applied. Sprint roadmap: Phases 54 (AI provenance + AI Act doctrine), 55 (subagent least-privilege + model-pinning), 56 (secret-scanning gate), 57 (override-friction escalator) queued. Previous phase -- Phase 52 sealed (feature). First phase in repo history authored under proper /qor-plan + /qor-audit + /qor-implement + /qor-substantiate skill invocations with all four real `.qor/gates/<sid>/*.json` artifacts written. Three sub-phases: (1) **Structural enforcement (keystone)** — new `qor/reliability/gate_chain_completeness.py` (103 lines) walks SESSION SEAL ledger entries and asserts plan/audit/implement/substantiate gate artifacts exist for sealed phases ≥ 52; new `ProvenanceError` + `QOR_SKILL_ACTIVE` env-var binding on `gate_chain.write_gate_artifact()` refuses calls without skill provenance (`QOR_GATE_PROVENANCE_OPTIONAL=1` autouse fixture in `tests/conftest.py` for test compatibility). (2) **G-1 SSDF tag emission** — new `qor/scripts/ssdf_tagger.py` (99 lines) computes practice tags from `change_class` + `files_touched` (via `git diff --name-only`); `/qor-substantiate` Step 7.4 emits `**SSDF Practices**:` line into SESSION SEAL entry; new `gate-chain-completeness` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` blocks PR merges to main on missing gate artifacts. (3) **Retroactive remediation + SG promotion** — closes Phase 46 razor VETO (`tests/test_doctrine_test_functionality.py` split via `tests/_helpers.py` extraction; both files ≤250 lines), Phase 48 presence-only test VETO (`tests/test_install_drift_check_subprocess.py` replaces source-grep with subprocess invocation), Phase 49 self-exempting cutoff VETO (`tests/test_attribution_tiered_negative_paths.py` adds 6 fixture-based synthetic-violator tests); 3 narrative SG entries promoted to structured countermeasures (SG-SkillProtocolBypass, SG-VacuousLint, SG-RecursiveBashInjection). 13 new files + 10 modified; 69 phase-specific tests; 910 full suite passing twice (delta +44 from Phase 50's 866 baseline). Variants regenerated (236 files, no drift). SSDF tag emission self-applied: this seal entry carries `**SSDF Practices**: PO.1.3, PO.1.4, PS.2.1, PS.3.1, PW.1.1, PW.4.1, PW.5.1, RV.1.1, RV.1.2`. Forward-only emission; entries < #169 grandfathered (immutable Merkle chain). `gate_chain_completeness.check(phase_min=52)` returns `ok=True` for this session's all four gate artifacts. Previous phase -- Phase 50 sealed (feature). Closes G-2 from `docs/compliance-re-evaluation-2026-04-29.md`. Skill prose performing filesystem operations on operator-controlled identifiers (`.qor/session/current`) MUST cite the canonical validator helper (`qor.scripts.session.current()` which validates against `SESSION_ID_PATTERN`). `qor/references/doctrine-owasp-governance.md` §A03 gains a "Skill-prose worked example" paragraph; `/qor-help --stuck` Mode protocol step 1 routes through the helper; `qor-implement` Step 5.5 and `qor-substantiate` Step 4.6 bash one-liners updated from `cat .qor/session/current` to `python -c "from qor.scripts.session import current; print(current() or 'default')"`. New 5-test lint with proximity-anchor + strip-and-fail. 866 tests passing twice (delta +5). Phase 49 badge currency enforcement self-applied (passes). Previous phase -- Phase 49 sealed (feature). Closes G-3 and G-4 from `docs/compliance-re-evaluation-2026-04-29.md`. (1) **Tiered attribution policy**: `qor/references/doctrine-attribution.md` `## Tiered usage` table defines required form per surface (seal commit / plan-audit-implement commits / merge / PR description / CHANGELOG / GitHub release); new `qor.scripts.attribution.commit_trailer_compact()` helper. (2) **README badge currency enforcement**: new `qor/scripts/badge_currency.py` (140 lines, pure functions, CLI entrypoint); `/qor-substantiate` Step 6.5 promoted from WARN to ABORT for `change_class ∈ {feature, breaking}`; hotfix exempt. (3) Self-application clean: this seal cycle's Tests badge updated to 862 (truth) and the new currency check passes. 23 new tests (9 attribution-tiering + 8 badge-currency + 6 substantiate-wiring), each invoking the unit and asserting on output, paired with strip-and-fail negative-paths per Phase 46 doctrine. Phase 33 release-doc currency satisfied: CHANGELOG.md `## [0.36.0]` section with the canonical attribution line `_Built via [Qor-logic SDLC](url)._`; pyproject.toml at 0.36.0. 861 tests passing on two consecutive runs (delta +23). Variant artifacts regenerated; 236 files, no drift. Previous phase -- Phase 48 sealed (feature). Three coupled UX/install/discovery improvements. (A) **Script discoverability**: closes the Phase 35 gap that fixed only `qor/reliability/`; the three remaining `qor/scripts/` skill invocations (`qor-shadow-process` lines 89/101 + `qor-process-review-cycle` line 57) now use module form `python -m qor.scripts.<name>` so they resolve against the installed package from any CWD. `doctrine-governance-enforcement.md` §138 rewritten symmetric across both `qor/scripts/` and `qor/reliability/`; §92 prose example also updated. New lints `tests/test_installed_import_paths.py::test_no_path_form_qor_scripts_invocations` + `::test_no_path_form_qor_reliability_invocations` prevent regression. (B) **`qor-logic` canonical CLI**: `pyproject.toml` `[project.scripts]` declares both `qor-logic = "qor.cli:main"` (canonical) and `qorlogic = "qor.cli:main"` (backwards-compat alias entry point). `argparse prog="qor-logic"`; `--version` emits `qor-logic <semver>`. 51 operator-facing CLI invocations renamed across `qor/skills/`, `qor/references/`, `README.md`, `docs/operations.md`, `docs/policies.md`. Filesystem state paths (`.qorlogic/config.json`, `.qorlogic-installed.json`) preserved for operator data integrity (negative-lookbehind regex excludes them). New `tests/test_cli_rename.py` locks both entry points + program-name output via `tomllib.loads` + `cli.main(["--version"])` capsys capture + `cli.main(["--help"])` capsys capture. New skill-prose lint `test_skill_prose_uses_qor_logic_for_cli_invocations` with self-test `test_qorlogic_cli_regex_excludes_filesystem_state_paths`. (C) **`/qor-help` conversational**: skill evolves from static catalog into three-mode skill. Bare `/qor-help` shows intro ("How to use /qor-help") + ASCII SDLC flow chart (plain ASCII, verified via `body.encode('ascii')` round-trip) + catalog tables + "Using /qor-help" section. `/qor-help --stuck` reads `.qor/session/current` and globs `.qor/gates/<sid>/*.json` to infer SDLC position (rank order: research < plan < audit < implement < substantiate), reads audit verdict if present, recommends next skill with rationale per `doctrine-audit-report-language.md`. `/qor-help -- "<question>"` routes free-form question against catalog + state, identifies 1-3 relevant skills with rationale; LLM running the skill is the routing engine, catalog is single source of truth. All modes are read-only; "NEVER execute other skills" constraint preserved. `tests/test_qor_help_conversational.py`: 5 positive proximity-anchored assertions paired with 5 strip-and-fail negative-paths per Phase 46 doctrine; ASCII chart positionally verified for SDLC phase order (research before plan before audit before implement before substantiate). Phase 33 release-doc currency satisfied: `CHANGELOG.md ## [0.35.0]` section added with Added + Changed entries; `pyproject.toml` at 0.35.0; system-tier docs (`docs/operations.md`, `docs/policies.md`) refreshed for the rename. Variant artifacts regenerated via `python -m qor.scripts.dist_compile`; 236 files, no drift. 838 tests passing on two consecutive runs (delta +21 from Phase 47's 817 baseline). **Substantiate remediation**: original Phase 48 substantiate cycle landed seal commit without writing META_LEDGER entries (eighth instance of SG-AdjacentState-A bookkeeping-gap dimension). Remediation: this entry triplet (#158 audit, #159 implement, #160 seal) added retroactively against Phase 47 chain (`1eb7bb31...`); seal commit amended; tag `v0.35.0` recreated at amended commit. Phase 47 step 7.7 gate would have caught the gap had `/qor-substantiate` skill been invoked — manual seal bypassed the skill protocol. Pattern signal: skill protocols are load-bearing; manual short-circuits violate doctrine even when convenient. Previous phase -- Phase 47 sealed (feature). Adds the structural countermeasure for SG-AdjacentState-A's bookkeeping-gap class — the family that allowed Phase 46's first substantiate to seal at v0.33.0 without writing META_LEDGER entries. New: `qor/reliability/seal_entry_check.py` (128 lines) — pure-function helper exposing `check(ledger_path, phase_num)` returning `SealEntryResult(ok, errors)`. Reads the ledger, asserts the latest entry is a SESSION SEAL for the given phase, verifies the chain hash is internally consistent (`chain_hash == chain_hash(content_hash, previous_hash)`), then runs full chain verification via `ledger_hash.verify()`. Single source of truth = the ledger; no caller-supplied Merkle seal expectation. Wired into `/qor-substantiate` as new **Step 7.7 (Post-seal verification)** between Step 7.6 (Stamp CHANGELOG) and Step 8 (Cleanup Staging) — runs *after* Step 7 (Final Merkle Seal) writes the entry. Bash one-liner uses hardcoded `python -c` (no shell-variable interpolation into Python literals) calling `governance_helpers.current_phase_plan_path()` to derive the plan path; argv-form `--plan "$PLAN_PATH"` invocation throughout. 15 phase-47 tests added: 9 behavioral tests (`tests/test_seal_entry_check.py`) including the meta-test `test_check_replays_phase_46_original_gap` that proves the new gate would have caught the historical sixth-instance gap, plus `test_cli_rejects_path_with_shell_metacharacters_safely` confirming argv-form eliminates the OWASP A03 vector flagged in Pass 1 V-3; 6 defensive wiring tests (`tests/test_substantiate_seal_entry_wiring.py`) using the proximity-anchor + strip-and-fail pattern from Phase 46 doctrine, including direct countermeasures locking V-1 (post-Step-7 placement), V-2 (no `$MERKLE_SEAL` reference), V-3 (no `python -c "...'$VAR'..."` interpolation) against future drift. Substantiate dogfoods Phase 47: Step 7.7 runs against Phase 47's own seal entry as part of this seal cycle. Phase 47 took three audit passes to reach PASS — Phase 1 (helper + tests) was sound on first attempt; Phase 2 wiring (bash glue between helper and skill step) was the recurring failure point across all three passes (V-1/V-2/V-3 in Pass 1 plan, V-1 in Pass 2 plan). SG-AdjacentState-A pattern signal: directives that specify "use X" without specifying "how to obtain X" leave a wiring slip surface. Phase 33 release-doc currency satisfied: CHANGELOG.md `## [0.34.0]` section added; pyproject.toml at 0.34.0; README.md badges refreshed. Variant artifacts regenerated under `qor/dist/variants/`; 211 files, no drift. 817 tests passing on two consecutive runs (delta +15). Previous phase -- Phase 46 sealed (feature). Codifies the "test functionality, not presence" principle as a first-class doctrine and wires enforcement language into the four SDLC gate skills. New: `qor/references/doctrine-test-functionality.md` (Principle, Definitions, Rule with the acceptance question — "If the unit's behavior were silently broken but the artifact still existed, would this test fail?", Anti-patterns table citing SG-035 and the Phase 45 originating instance, Verification mechanisms, Update protocol). CLAUDE.md Authority line links the new doctrine alongside `attribution`. `/qor-plan` Step 4 forbids presence-only test descriptions; Step 5 review checklist requires each test description to name the behavior it confirms. `/qor-audit` gains a Test Functionality Pass between Section 4 Razor and Dependency Audit (VETO with `test-failure` category against any plan whose described tests do not invoke the unit). `/qor-implement` Step 5 (TDD-Light) requires the failing test invoke the unit and assert against its output; Step 9 scans newly-added tests for the `assert <substring> in <file_text>` family. `/qor-substantiate` Step 4 Test Audit refuses to seal if a phase-added test is presence-only. `tests/test_doctrine_test_functionality.py` locks each surface with proximity-anchored regex assertions paired with strip-and-fail negative-path tests so the doctrine test cannot itself decay into a presence-only check (every positive proximity assertion is paired with a corresponding negative-path test that proves stripping the named section makes the positive assertion fail). 20/20 doctrine tests green twice in a row. Variant artifacts regenerated under `qor/dist/variants/`. Substantiate remediation: Phase 46's original seal commit landed without META_LEDGER entries; this seal cycle adds Entry #150 (audit), #151 (implementation), #152 (seal) and rebases onto Phase 45 to compute correct chain hashes. Previous phase -- Phase 45 sealed (feature). Implements GitHub issue #18 — a documented convention for crediting Qor-logic SDLC in commit trailers, PR footers, and CHANGELOG attribution lines, plus a pure Python helper as the canonical source of the strings. New: `qor/scripts/attribution.py` (3 pure functions: `commit_trailer`, `pr_footer`, `changelog_attribution_line`; module-level constants are the single source of truth, kwargs override per-call), `qor/references/doctrine-attribution.md` (full doctrine including the narrowly-scoped emoji exception for bot-attribution trailer text), root `ATTRIBUTION.md` (one-screen quick-ref with copy-pasteable strings). CLAUDE.md Authority line updated. 15 phase-45 tests added: 10 unit/functionality (including a real `git interpret-trailers --parse` check that catches trailer-format drift presence-tests would miss) + 5 drift-guard tests asserting helper output appears verbatim across the doc surfaces. No skill wiring this phase by design (option B: doc + helper, defer wiring); follow-up Phase 46 will enforce test-functionality in Qor-logic's own SDLC skill prompts. Audit blind spot logged: Phase 45 audit cleared all six structural passes but missed two plan-format conventions (`change_class` enum, heading capitalization) that block the repo's own `tests/test_skill_doctrine.py` and `tests/test_plan_schema_ci_commands.py`; mid-implement plan corrections applied. 782 tests passing on two consecutive runs (delta +15). Previous phase -- Phase 44 sealed (hotfix). Resolves a Phase 41 regression: `qor/scripts/ledger_hash.py`'s strict `**Field**` anchor silently skipped SESSION SEAL entries with the standard `**Chain Hash (Merkle seal)**:` / `**Content Hash (session seal)**:` markup convention (7 ledger entries: #126, #129, #132, #133, #137, #140, #143). Three-regex relaxation adds optional parenthetical suffix `(?:\s*\([^)]+\))?` inside bold markers; preserves Phase 41's bold-anchor + bounded-span + two-form value protections. Anti-vacuous-green tests added: every modern (≥#116) entry with hash markup must verify; counts verified entries against the real ledger rather than relying on `rc == 0`. Verifier metric: pre-fix 104 OK / 39 skipped; post-fix 112 OK / 32 skipped. SG-AdjacentState-A (provisional family across Phase 41/42/43/44 plan blind spots) — fourth instance promotes the family to formal SG status; the anti-vacuous-green guard provides the structural countermeasure. Previous phase -- Phase 41 sealed (feature). Resolves GitHub issue #13. Three-axis scope: (1) `qor/scripts/ledger_hash.py` `CONTENT_HASH_RE` and `PREV_HASH_RE` now accept fenced `= <hex>` form (new capability, symmetric with `CHAIN_HASH_RE`); (2) all three regexes now require `**Field**` bold anchor and use a bounded non-greedy span via negative lookahead on the next `**FieldName**` marker (eliminates a class of cross-field-bleed accidents); (3) `qor-validate/SKILL.md` Steps 3/4/7 now reference `qor/scripts/ledger_hash.py` + `qorlogic verify-ledger` CLI instead of the stub `.claude/commands/scripts/validate-ledger.py` path. Phase 33 doctrine release-doc currency satisfied: CHANGELOG.md `## [0.31.0]` section + README.md badge refresh (Tests 602→752, Ledger 104→140). 8 new regression tests; 3 existing tests amended with `capsys`-based `OK   Entry #N:` assertions; new `tests/test_qor_validate_skill_references.py` lints source + dist variants. Intent-lock verified first-try post-implement-commit (Phase 43's ancestry fix working live). Previous phase -- Phase 43 sealed (hotfix). Replaces strict HEAD-equality check in `qor/reliability/intent_lock.py` `verify()` with `git merge-base --is-ancestor` ancestry check. Captured HEAD must be reachable from current HEAD; current HEAD may be any forward descendant. Plan-hash and audit-hash equality checks unchanged. Eliminates the re-capture-as-SOP anti-pattern observed in Phase 41 and Phase 42 substantiate where the implement commit between Step 5.5 capture and Step 4.6 verify always tripped `DRIFT: head`. Real anti-drift threats (history rewrites, hard resets, branch switches to divergent histories) still caught. SG-AdjacentState-A (provisional family) logged across Phase 41/42/43 Pass 1 plan-blind-spots — countermeasure becoming reflexive. Previous phase -- Phase 42 sealed (hotfix). Resolves the chicken-and-egg CI failure that blocked PRs #10 (v0.29.0) and #11 (v0.30.0). `test_every_changelog_section_has_tag` now exempts pre-release CHANGELOG sections — versions above the highest existing git tag — from the match-a-tag rule, breaking the collision with Phase 40's LOCAL-ONLY tag doctrine. Pure `_released_orphans(versions, tags)` helper extracted; three direct-call TDD tests cover above-highest / at-or-below-highest / no-tags cases. CHANGELOG.md backfilled with `## [0.28.1]` (Phase 40 retrospective) and `## [0.28.2]` (this hotfix) so the symmetric `test_every_tag_has_changelog_section` is satisfied against origin tags. Local orphan tags v0.29.0 and v0.30.0 (from unmerged phase 39/39b seals) deleted; will be recreated on respective merge commits. 716 tests passing on two consecutive runs. Previous phase -- Phase 33 sealed. Seal-tag timing bug (off-by-one across v0.19.0-v0.22.0) fixed — `governance_helpers.create_seal_tag` now takes a required `commit: str` positional; `/qor-substantiate` Step 7.5 reduced to `bump_version` only; new Step 9.5.5 captures the post-commit SHA via `git rev-parse HEAD` and tags it. Release-doc currency rule added (Phase 33 addition to Step 6.5): when `plan.change_class ∈ {feature, breaking}`, README.md and CHANGELOG.md must appear in `implement.files_touched`; hotfix exempt. SG-Phase33-A records the historical bug + countermeasure; META_LEDGER Entry #112 backfills the 4 affected-tag inventory (historical tags not retagged — rewriting published remote discouraged; no consumer depends on them). 636 tests passing on two consecutive runs (delta +14). First phase branch to start from a reconciliation-merge base (`git merge --no-ff v0.23.0` as Phase 33's first commit) to bring phase/32-amended content back into scope after the PR #4 auto-merge race published pre-amend content to main. Phase 32 prior -- Check Surface D + E are now LIVE STRICT at `/qor-substantiate` Step 4.7 -- any term-drift or cross-doc conflict ABORTs seal. Check Surface D + E are now LIVE STRICT at `/qor-substantiate` Step 4.7 -- any term-drift or cross-doc conflict ABORTs seal. Zero-drift baseline established in Phase 2 via `docs/*.md` archive-by-default scope-fence (only the 4 system-tier docs are living; README + CHANGELOG excluded as narrative entry points) plus broad `referenced_by:` adoption for high-usage terms. Install drift check (`qor/scripts/install_drift_check.py`) SHA256-compares source SKILL.md vs installed copies; invoked as CLI or at `/qor-plan` Step 0.2 as pre-phase WARN. Doctrine §8 Install Currency documents the contract. 622 tests passing on two consecutive runs (delta +20). Phase 32 is the first plan to substantiate under live strict-mode D/E and passed cleanly on first attempt -- the zero-drift baseline held. Previous phase --  Operationalization bundle closes 8 of the 10 items from the post-Phase-30 gap inventory. New machinery: `/qor-substantiate` Step 6.5 Documentation Currency Check (WARNs when doc-affecting changes ship without system-tier doc updates); Check Surface D/E scope-fence tuning (doctrine-peer + home-dir-peer + per-entry scope_exclude); `doc_integrity_drift_report.py` operator CLI; `pr_citation_lint.py` + `.github/workflows/pr-lint.yml` enforcing doctrine-governance-enforcement §6 on every PR; SHA256 install-sync test catching dist drift at CI time; session marker path unified (`MARKER_PATH` = `.qor/session/current`). Live drift triage artifact `docs/phase31-drift-triage-report.md` captures residual-known-drift state. Path-unification migration had a lossy moment at first Phase 31 substantiate attempt (old `.qor/current_session` vs new `.qor/session/current` marker files both exist with different contents; manual migration applied). 602 tests passing on two consecutive runs (delta +29). SG-Phase31-A (in-plan correction parallel to source instead of upstream fix) + SG-Phase31-B (plan self-modification post-audit) codified; both countermeasures applied live during pass-1 VETO -> pass-2 PASS amendment. First seal to exercise Step 6.5 against its own output -- caught 9 currency warnings, system-tier docs amended mid-substantiate.

All canonical Qor content lives under `qor/`. Variant outputs (`claude`, `kilo-code`, `codex`) are deferred until Phase 2 re-introduces the compile pipeline.

## Shipped tooling

Compile pipeline, gate chain runtime, shadow threshold automation, cross-repo collector, platform detect, and validation suite were all shipped across Phases 10-23. Current tooling surface is operational:

- CLI: `qor-logic install|uninstall|list|init|info|compile|verify-ledger|seed|compliance|policy` (Phase 48: canonical name; `qorlogic` retained as backwards-compat alias)
- Python modules: `qor/seed.py`, `qor/tone.py`, `qor/install.py`, `qor/hosts.py`, `qor/scripts/veto_pattern.py`, `qor/scripts/gemini_variant.py`, `qor/scripts/dist_compile.py`, `qor/scripts/ledger_hash.py`, `qor/scripts/shadow_process.py`
- Tests: 462 passing (unit + integration + e2e + doctrine + bundle contract)
- Supported hosts: claude, kilo-code, codex, gemini (all with repo/global scope)
- Communication tiers: technical / standard / plain via `/qor-tone` or `qorlogic init --tone`
- Shadow Genome events: 7 structured `event_type` enum values (incl. `repeated_veto_pattern` from Phase 26)

## Advisory-gate overrides carried

One sev-1 `gate_override` event logged in `docs/PROCESS_SHADOW_GENOME.md` against the 5-round audit loop verdicts on the full plan. User-approved per `/qor-debug` analysis. Remaining violations (V-1..V-5) are addressed in `plan-qor-ssot-minimal.md` or explicitly carried as known risk.

## Phase 36 (v0.26.0 — 2026-04-20): two-stage addressed flip in /qor-remediate

Phase scoped to B19 only after a four-pass audit loop on the original Phase 36 plan (archived at `docs/plan-qor-phase36-planaudit-loop-countermeasures.archived.md`) surfaced V1-V10 across progressively deeper infrastructure-alignment mismatches. `/qor-remediate` Entry #122 proposal was accepted 2026-04-20; scope narrowed.

**Shipped**:
- Schema: `addressed_pending` optional field + `allOf` invariant (`shadow_event.schema.json`); `reviews_remediate_gate` optional field (`audit.schema.json`).
- Script: `remediate_mark_addressed.py` rewritten into two-stage API (`mark_addressed_pending` + `mark_addressed`) with `ReviewAttestationError`. 4 functions each under the Razor 40-line limit.
- Skills: `/qor-remediate` Step 4 calls pending variant; new Step 6 documents review-pass flip invoked from `/qor-audit`. `/qor-audit` Step 4.1 captures `reviews-remediate:<path>` operator arg; Step 4.2 invokes `mark_addressed` on PASS.
- Doctrine: §10.1 "Two-stage remediation flip," §10.2 "Narrative SG entry closure."
- Tests: `test_shadow_event_schema.py` NEW (5 tests); `test_remediate.py` +10 new + 3 existing updated to pending-stage API. 654 passed across 2 consecutive runs (delta +12).

**SG closures**:
- SG-PlanAuditLoop-A: partially closed. B19 ships the first countermeasure (advisory-until-reviewed enforced). C2-C4 (stall detection, cycle-count escalation, CI-command slot) deferred to Phase 37/38.
- SG-Phase36-A: active but not triggered in this phase (narrow B19 scope did not re-expose the specification-drift pattern).

**Deferred** (per BACKLOG post-Phase-35 queue):
- Phase 37: B20/B21 + gate artifact accumulation infrastructure. Plan authored at `docs/plan-qor-phase37-stall-detection-infrastructure.md` — unmerged, unreviewed.
- Phase 38: B22 `ci_commands` schema slot.
- Phase 39: context-discipline doctrine + persona context-prioritization reframe (research brief `.agent/staging/RESEARCH_BRIEF.md`; META_LEDGER #116).

## Phase 37 (v0.27.0 — 2026-04-20): stall-detection infrastructure (B20 + B21)

Closes C2-C4 countermeasures from SG-PlanAuditLoop-A. Phase 36 shipped B19 (two-stage addressed flip) as prerequisite; Phase 37 ships the full stall-detection machinery on append-only audit history.

**Shipped**:
- `qor/scripts/audit_history.py` NEW — append-only `.qor/gates/<sid>/audit_history.jsonl` alongside singleton. Solves V10 from original Phase 36 plan.
- `qor/scripts/findings_signature.py` NEW — 16-hex-char SHA256 prefix over sorted unique `findings_categories`; `"LEGACY"` sentinel for absent field; `UnmappedCategoryError` on non-enum.
- `qor/scripts/stall_walk.py` NEW — shared walker returning `(count, signature, first_match_ts)` for both escalator and classifier.
- `qor/scripts/cycle_count_escalator.py` NEW — K=3 orchestrator + session-scoped suppression marker.
- `qor/scripts/orchestration_override.py` NEW — severity-2 event + suppression marker.
- Schema: `audit.schema.json` `findings_categories` 12-value closed enum + `allOf` required-on-VETO; `shadow_event.schema.json` event_type +`plan-replay` +`orchestration_override`.
- Classifier: `remediate_pattern_match` gate-loop unions `gate_override | orchestration_override`; plan-replay pattern added with gate-loop dedup.
- Skills: `/qor-plan` Step 2c cycle-count hook; `/qor-audit` Step 0.5 cycle-count hook + new 7th Infrastructure Alignment Pass.
- Doctrine: §10.3 audit history + findings signature; §10.4 cycle-count escalation; §10.5 override + suppression; new `SG-InfrastructureMismatch` countermeasure in the catalog.
- Tests: 46 new across 8 new files + 5 new in `test_remediate` + 1 update in `test_audit_gate_artifact`. 705 passed x2.

**SG closures**:
- SG-PlanAuditLoop-A: **fully closed** (C1 Phase 36, C2-C4 Phase 37).
- SG-Phase36-A: active; authoring discipline held.
- SG-InfrastructureMismatch: codified in countermeasure catalog this phase.

**Procedural surface freeze line**: v0.28.0 (after Phase 38). Phase 39 (context-discipline / persona reshape) explicitly deferred pending upstream consumer lockdown.

## Phase 38 (v0.28.0 — 2026-04-20): ci_commands schema slot (B22) — **FREEZE LINE**

Trivial scope: one schema field + one skill template section + one 6-test file. Establishes v0.28.0 as the procedural-surface freeze line per user direction for upstream consumer lockdown.

**Shipped**:
- `qor/gates/schema/plan.schema.json` — `ci_commands` required array (minItems 1, item minLength 1).
- `qor/skills/sdlc/qor-plan/SKILL.md` §Plan Structure — new `## CI Commands` template section + Phase 38 contract note.
- `tests/test_plan_schema_ci_commands.py` NEW (6 tests covering required-field enforcement, empty-array rejection, empty-string rejection, valid-case acceptance, skill-prose lint, grandfathering for pre-Phase-38 markdown plans).
- 9 existing plan-payload test fixtures updated to include `ci_commands` (payloads represent Phase-38-era consumers).
- `CHANGELOG.md` v0.27.0 section authored (Phase 37 debt).

**Procedural surface frozen**:
- Skill protocols (qor-plan/audit/remediate/implement/substantiate) — stable
- Event-type enum (9 values) — stable
- Gate-artifact schemas (plan + ci_commands now required, audit + findings_categories/reviews_remediate_gate, shadow_event + addressed_pending) — stable
- Findings categories enum (12 values) — stable
- Delegation table (108 handoffs) — stable
- Doctrine §10.1-10.5 — stable

**Deferred beyond freeze**:
- Phase 39: context-discipline doctrine + persona reshape (~30 skill files, M4 A/B harness). Explicitly out of scope pending upstream consumer lockdown against v0.28.0.

## Phase 39 Phases 1+2 (v0.29.0 — 2026-04-20): context-discipline doctrine + A/B harness infrastructure

Partial phase seal. Phases 1 and 2 of the 4-phase plan ship in v0.29.0; Phases 3 (live A/B run) and 4 (persona sweep + conditional Identity Activation rewrites) deferred to a separate operator-driven cycle.

**Phase 1 shipped** — doctrine codification:
- `qor/references/doctrine-context-discipline.md` NEW. 5 sections: three-mechanism distinction (frontmatter tag vs Identity Activation prose vs subagent invocation), persona-as-context-prioritization-scaffold rule, stance directive discipline, subagent invocation rule (`general` by default; persona-typed requires evidence), verification protocol requiring `<persona-evidence>` pointers.
- `qor/references/doctrine-governance-enforcement.md` §11 cross-reference.
- `tests/test_doctrine_context_discipline.py` — 3 structural tests.

**Phase 2 shipped** — A/B harness infrastructure (Anthropic SDK):
- `qor/scripts/ab_harness.py` — pure library (5 public functions + helpers), mockable, never reads env. `load_manifest`, `load_variant`, `score_response`, `run(variant, skill, client, ...)`, `compare`, `aggregate_runs`.
- `qor/scripts/ab_live_run.py` — operator CLI. Reads `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`; exits clearly if absent; builds real `anthropic.Anthropic()` client; runs 2 skills × 2 variants × 5 runs × 20 defects = 400 API calls.
- `tests/fixtures/ab_corpus/` — 20 seeded defects across 10 `findings_categories` (2 per category, omitting `coverage-gap` and `dependency-unjustified` per plan). Each fixture carries `# SEEDED TEST DEFECT — NOT EXECUTABLE` header. `MANIFEST.json` uses `line_start` + `line_end` fields for multi-line defect ranges.
- `tests/fixtures/ab_corpus/variants/` — 4 hand-authored Identity Activation variant files (`qor-audit.persona.md`, `qor-audit.stance.md`, `qor-substantiate.persona.md`, `qor-substantiate.stance.md`).
- `pyproject.toml` — `anthropic>=0.40,<1.0` under `[project.optional-dependencies].ab-harness`. Default installs do not pull this dependency.
- `tests/test_ab_harness.py` — 16 CI tests, all Anthropic calls mocked.

**Deferred (Phase 39b)**:
- Phase 3 (operator action): `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=... python qor/scripts/ab_live_run.py` produces `docs/phase39-ab-results.md`. Cost ~$32 per full cycle at Opus 4.7 pricing (corrected from plan's earlier ~$4 estimate). ~10-15 min wall-time.
- Phase 4 (conditional on Phase 3 results): S3 persona sweep across 24 skills; R3 Identity Activation rewrites fire only if Phase 3 declares `winner: "stance"`; R4 (qor-debug → doctrine cross-reference); R5 (qor-document persona-vs-agent disambiguation).

**Cost awareness (corrected from Pass 2 audit O1)**: actual skill body sizes are ~4,000-4,500 tokens each, not the plan's original ~500-token per-call assumption. Real cost ~$32 per full A/B cycle at Opus 4.7 pricing. Codified in `ab_harness.py` module docstring.

## Phase 39b Phases 1+2 (v0.30.0 — 2026-04-20): Agent Team A/B + persona sweep

Supersedes the v0.29.0 anthropic-SDK approach. Ships:
- `/qor-ab-run` skill orchestrating A/B via parallel Task-tool subagent dispatch (20 concurrent calls, zero external dep, aligned with doctrine §4 subagent invocation rule).
- `qor/scripts/ab_aggregator.py` pure-Python reducer: brace-balanced JSON extraction, malformed-tolerant, mean+stddev, winner declaration (±5pp tie threshold), markdown rendering.
- Subagent prompt template with `{VARIANT_IDENTITY_ACTIVATION_BLOCK}` + `{FIXTURES_CONCATENATED}` placeholders.
- Delegation-table + `/qor-help` catalog entries.

**Persona sweep applied**:
- **S3**: 5 decorative `<persona>` tags removed (`qor-status`, `qor-help`, `qor-repo-scaffold`, `qor-bootstrap`, `qor-document`).
- **R4**: `qor-debug` line 108 subagent_type constraint cross-references `doctrine-context-discipline.md` §4.
- **R5**: `qor-document` splits Identity Activation stance (main thread) from subagent pairing (`Task` dispatch) citing doctrine §1.2/§1.3.
- **R3 pending**: test `test_identity_activation_matches_ab_winner_if_results_exist` enforces conditional rewrite when operator produces `docs/phase39-ab-results.md` via `/qor-ab-run`.
- **LOAD_BEARING_PENDING_EVIDENCE registry** (19 skills): documented transitional state awaiting A/B evidence.

**Tests**: 743 pytest green × 2. Admission: `qor-ab-run` admitted. Matrix: 29 skills, 112 handoffs, 0 broken.

**Naming note**: branch `phase/39b-*` + plan `plan-qor-phase39b-*.md` use letter-suffix convention not supported by `governance_helpers._BRANCH_PHASE_RE` + `_PHASE_FILENAME_RE` (digit-only). Version bump performed manually (0.29.0 → 0.30.0). Future sub-phases should use next digit (e.g., phase/41) to remain compatible with automated bump.

## Phase 41 (v0.31.0): build-and-publish workflow + Phase 40 doctrine

Ledger Entry #143. Annotated tags created LOCAL ONLY until PR merge per Phase 40 doctrine to prevent stale-tag publishing. Build-and-publish workflow refuses to publish tags not reachable from main (Phase 40 guard).

## Phase 45 (v0.32.0): attribution-trailer convention

Ledger Entry #149. Canonical full trailer for seal commits + compact `Co-Authored-By:` for plan/audit/implement commits. `qor/scripts/attribution.py` `commit_trailer()` / `commit_trailer_compact()` / `pr_footer()` / `changelog_attribution_line()` helpers. Locked by `tests/test_attribution_tiered_usage.py`.

## Phase 46 (v0.33.0): test-functionality doctrine

Ledger Entry #152. Doctrine `qor/references/doctrine-test-functionality.md` requires unit tests to invoke the unit and assert on output, not artifact existence. SG-035 ("doctrine-content test unanchored") codified. /qor-audit Test Functionality Pass added.

## Phase 47 (v0.34.0): seal-entry-check at substantiate

Ledger Entry #157. New reliability gate at substantiate Step 7.7 verifies SESSION SEAL entry was actually written (closes SG-AdjacentState-A bookkeeping-gap subclass). Substantiate cycles cannot complete without writing the SESSION SEAL ledger entry.

## Phase 48 (v0.35.0): governance-enforcement doctrine §10 expansions

Ledger Entry #160. Doctrine `qor/references/doctrine-governance-enforcement.md` extended with §10.1 (two-stage remediation flip), §10.2 (SG narrative closure protocol), §10.3-10.5 (cycle-count escalation + orchestration-override + gate-loop classifier). Subagent invocation rule clarified.

## Phase 49 (v0.36.0): Phase 11D + Phase 28 documentation integrity strict mode

Ledger Entry #163. /qor-substantiate Step 4.7 runs `doc_integrity.run_all_checks_from_plan` strict mode; ABORTs on `ValueError`. `legacy` doc_tier bypasses checks. Topology + glossary + orphan checks enforced at seal time.

## Phase 50 (v0.37.0): co-occurrence behavior invariant model

Ledger Entry #166. Test pattern: instead of substring grep for "test K invokes M", parse the AST/frontmatter and assert "for every SKILL.md whose phase: X, body MUST contain invocation Y". Anchored to actual frontmatter-declaration set; not single-skill substring. Phase 50 model used by all subsequent phases.

## Phase 52 (v0.38.0): provenance binding for write_gate_artifact

Ledger Entry #169. `gate_chain.write_gate_artifact` refuses writes from contexts that have not declared `QOR_SKILL_ACTIVE=<phase>` env var. Closes the bypass surface that allowed Phases 46/48/49/50 to silently land defective work. `QOR_GATE_PROVENANCE_OPTIONAL=1` test-only bypass; autouse fixture in conftest.py sets it.

## Phase 53 (v0.39.0): OWASP LLM01 prompt-injection canary scanner

Ledger Entry #174. `qor/scripts/prompt_injection_canaries.py` (~155 LOC) scans operator-authored governance markdown (docs/, qor/references/) for canary patterns before any other audit pass. /qor-audit Step 3 Prompt Injection Pass invokes; canary hit → VETO with `prompt-injection` category. New `compute_governance_attributes` driver for Cedar `forbid has_prompt_injection_canary` rule. SG-PromptInjection-A codified.

## Phase 54 (v0.40.0): EU AI Act + AI RMF alignment

Ledger Entry #178. `ai_provenance` field on every gate artifact (system, version, host, model_family, human_oversight, ts). `qor/scripts/ai_provenance.py` (~140 LOC) builds manifests; `qor/scripts/override_friction.py` requires ≥50-char justification on third consecutive override. New `qor/references/doctrine-eu-ai-act.md` + `doctrine-ai-rmf.md`. `qor-logic compliance ai-provenance` aggregator. Closes EU AI Act Art. 13/14/50 + NIST AI RMF MEASURE-2.1 / MANAGE-1.1.

## Phase 55 (v0.41.0): Cedar admission + model-pinning + CycloneDX SBOM + pre-audit lints + deliver schema

Ledger Entry #182. Two new `forbid` rules in `qor/policies/skill_admission.cedar` over `actual_tool_invocations_exceed_scope` + `actual_subagent_invocations_exceed_scope`. New `compute_skill_admission_attributes` + `_CANONICAL_TOOLS` frozenset. 8 scoped skills declare `model_compatibility:` + `min_model_capability:`. New `qor/scripts/sbom_emit.py` (~145 LOC, hand-rolled CycloneDX v1.5, zero new deps). New `qor/cli_handlers/release.py` `do_sbom`. New `qor/gates/schema/deliver.schema.json` closes pre-existing surface gap. New `qor/scripts/plan_test_lint.py` + `plan_grep_lint.py` pre-audit lints at /qor-audit Step 0.6. SG-PreAuditLintGap-A codified. Closes OWASP LLM05 + LLM07 + AI RMF GV-6.1 + MG-3.1.

## Phase 56 (v0.42.0): secret-scanning gate at /qor-substantiate Step 4.6.5

Ledger Entry #185. `qor/scripts/secret_scanner.py` (~248 LOC, 11-pattern frozen catalog, 15-entry `_ALLOWLIST`, gitleaks v8 schema findings JSON, redacted match form). New `compute_production_attributes` drives long-dormant Cedar `has_hardcoded_secrets` attribute (rule on books since Phase 23). /qor-substantiate Step 4.6.5 invokes `python -m qor.scripts.secret_scanner --staged --out dist/secrets.findings.json || ABORT`. SG-SecretLeakAtSeal-A codified. Closes OWASP LLM06 + NIST AI 600-1 §2.10. Five-phase compliance sprint complete.

## Phase 57 (v0.43.0 — 2026-05-01): `gate_written` observer channel (PR #12 + B24 reintegration)

Reintegrates PR #12 `feat/b24-gate-written-hooks` (FailSafe-Pro B24 contribution, opened 2026-04-20) on top of current main with the OWASP A04 SIGINT-swallow VETO ground from Entry #186 explicitly resolved. Net-new public-API surface for downstream governance-ledger bridges to observe gate writes without filesystem polling. Aligns with OWASP LLM Top 10 (2025) **LLM07 Insecure Plugin Design** at the contract layer.

**Phase 1 — `gate_hooks` module**:
- `qor/scripts/gate_hooks.py` (165 LOC, zero new runtime deps; PyYAML already locked).
- Frozen `GateWrittenEvent(phase, session_id, artifact_path, payload_sha256, ts)` and `_HookTarget` dataclasses.
- `dispatch_gate_written(event)` synchronous fan-out: entry-points (under group `qor_logic.events.gate_written`) first, then `<root>/.qor/hooks.yaml` config-file entries (top-to-bottom). Deterministic ordering; no concurrency.
- `reload_entry_points()` test-only cache invalidator.
- JSONL hook-log at `<root>/.qor/hooks/hooks.log` (ts, hook, event, status, duration_ms, [exception]).
- **Critical Phase 57 fix**: `except Exception` (NOT `BaseException`) in `_invoke_hook_safely`. `KeyboardInterrupt` and `SystemExit` propagate so operators retain Ctrl-C control over runaway hooks.

**Phase 2 — `gate_chain` post-write hook fire**:
- `qor/scripts/gate_chain.py:_fire_gate_written_hook` (15-line bridging helper).
- Fires AFTER Phase 52 provenance check, AFTER `vga.write_artifact`, AFTER Phase 37 `audit_history.append`, BEFORE function return.
- Reads artifact bytes back from disk to compute `payload_sha256` so the event matches what's persisted (no in-memory/on-disk drift).
- Wrapped in `try/except Exception` so hook errors never break the authoritative write path.

**Phase 3 — doctrine + glossary + countermeasure + CHANGELOG**:
- `qor/references/doctrine-hook-contract.md` (NEW, ~95 LOC): applicability + event payload + entry-point + config-file format + invocation order + log format + trust model + performance + Phase 57 changes vs. PR #12 origin.
- `qor/references/doctrine-shadow-genome-countermeasures.md` extended with `SG-BareExceptionSwallowsSignals-A` codifying the BaseException-swallow risk class with corrected `except Exception` and cleanup-then-reraise patterns.
- `qor/references/glossary.md` extended with 2 new terms: `gate_written hook`, `hook contract`.
- CHANGELOG `[0.43.0] - 2026-05-01` entry.
- README badges: Tests 1142 → 1176, Doctrines 20 → 21, Ledger 188 → 190.

**Trust model**: hooks execute arbitrary code from the consumer's repo. Mirrors `.github/workflows/`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `Makefile`, npm `preinstall`. Documented explicitly in `qor/references/doctrine-hook-contract.md`; qor-logic does NOT sandbox, sign, or vet hooks.

**Tests**: 1175 pytest passing × 2 (deterministic). +34 new Phase 57 tests including AST-anchored static check that `_invoke_hook_safely` never catches `BaseException`, behavioral regression that `KeyboardInterrupt` and `SystemExit` propagate through dispatch, Phase 50 AST-based co-occurrence behavior invariant for the `gate_chain` ↔ `gate_hooks` wiring, Phase 52 provenance-still-enforced regression.

**Reliability sweep**: intent-lock VERIFIED, skill admission ADMITTED, gate-skill matrix 29 skills/112 handoffs/0 broken, secret-scan EXIT 0 (Phase 56 substantiate Step 4.6.5 self-application clean), dist 4 variants OK (236 files, no drift), badge currency OK.

**Razor compliance**: `gate_hooks.py` 165 LOC (under 250 cap); longest function `_resolve_config_entry` ~22 LOC; max nesting depth 2; zero nested ternaries.

**Resolves Entry #186 VETO grounds explicitly**:
1. ✅ `except Exception` (not `BaseException`) — SIGINT/SystemExit propagate; AST-anchored regression test in place.
2. ✅ Built on top of current main (`d5726e9` post-Phase-56), not a stale-branch merge.
3. ✅ Module docstring cites Phase 57 + LLM07 framework gap; FailSafe-Pro origin attribution moves to CHANGELOG per Phase 53/54/55/56 docstring discipline.

**Companion**: Phase 58 plan + audit gate artifact (`docs/plan-qor-phase58-ideation-readiness-phase.md`, Issue #20 `/qor-ideate`) committed alongside this seal as governance records (audit PASS at Entry #188). Phase 58 implementation can proceed independently after this PR merges.

**Decision**: Phase 57 sealed at v0.43.0. PR #12 superseded by this seal; close after merge with link to Entry #190. FailSafe-Pro `failsafe-qor-hook` consumer (their B24 PR) can register under `qor_logic.events.gate_written` and observe governance writes without filesystem polling.

## Phase 58 (v0.44.0 — 2026-05-02): procedural-fidelity check + tech-debt wrap-up (B23 closure)

Closes B23 (operator request from Phase 57 substantiate cycle where doc-surface gaps were caught manually) by shipping a static-analysis procedural-fidelity check at /qor-substantiate Step 4.6.6 with WARN-posture severity-2 events to the Process Shadow Genome. Plus three tech-debt wrap-up items: SYSTEM_STATE.md backfill for 12 sealed phases (41, 45-50, 52-56) with forward-only drift-prevention test, conftest.py session-end cleanup of `.qor/gates/test*` pollution, and Phase 58→59 ideation plan rename (Issue #20 ideation moves to Phase 59 since the Phase 58 slot is now this tech-debt scope). Codifies `SG-DocSurfaceUncovered-A` countermeasure.

**Phase 1 — `procedural_fidelity` module + substantiate Step 4.6.6 wiring**:
- `qor/scripts/procedural_fidelity.py` (~190 LOC, zero new runtime deps).
- Frozen `Deviation` dataclass + `DEVIATION_CLASSES` frozenset (4 v1 classes: `doc-surface-uncovered` active, `missing-step` / `ordering-drift` / `argv-shape-divergence` reserved as stubs).
- `check_seal_commit(repo_root, session_id)` reads `.qor/gates/<sid>/implement.json` `files_touched` and runs detectors. Empty list = clean.
- `_detect_doc_surface_coverage` is the v1 detector: `qor/skills/`, `qor/scripts/`, `qor/references/doctrine-`, or `qor/gates/schema/` paths in `files_touched` require at least one of the four system-tier docs (`docs/SYSTEM_STATE.md`, `docs/operations.md`, `docs/architecture.md`, `docs/lifecycle.md`).
- CLI: `python -m qor.scripts.procedural_fidelity --session SID [--repo-root .] [--out PATH]`. Exit 0 always (WARN posture); stderr WARN on deviations; exit 2 only on missing implement gate. Severity-2 events to Process Shadow Genome via `shadow_process.append_event`.
- Substantiate Step 4.6.6 between existing Step 4.6.5 (Phase 56 secret-scan, BLOCK semantics) and Step 4.7 (Phase 28 doc-integrity, ABORT). WARN-only invocation; no `|| ABORT`.

**Phase 2 — SYSTEM_STATE.md backfill + drift prevention**:
- 12 sealed phases backfilled: 41 (v0.31.0), 45 (v0.32.0), 46 (v0.33.0), 47 (v0.34.0), 48 (v0.35.0), 49 (v0.36.0), 50 (v0.37.0), 52 (v0.38.0), 53 (v0.39.0), 54 (v0.40.0), 55 (v0.41.0), 56 (v0.42.0). One concise paragraph per phase extracted from corresponding META_LEDGER seal entry.
- New `tests/test_system_state_phase_coverage.py` enforces forward-only invariant: every `### Entry #N: SESSION SEAL -- Phase X feature substantiated` ledger entry must have a corresponding `## Phase X (vY.Z.W)` heading in SYSTEM_STATE.md, modulo `_NO_SEAL_PHASES = {42, 43, 44, 51}` for adjacent-work-absorbed phases.
- Meta-coherence: this very Phase 58 entry is required by the test the same phase ships. Drift-prevention dogfooded.

**Phase 3 — conftest cleanup + ideation rename + doctrine + glossary + SG + CHANGELOG**:
- `tests/conftest.py`: new session-scope autouse cleanup fixture sweeping `.qor/gates/test*`, `cli-*`, `tN` pollution at session-end. Pattern conservative; never matches timestamp-prefixed real session IDs.
- `docs/plan-qor-phase58-ideation-readiness-phase.md` → `docs/plan-qor-phase59-ideation-readiness-phase.md` rename. Plan body Phase 58 → Phase 59 substring updates (19 occurrences).
- `qor/references/doctrine-procedural-fidelity.md` (NEW, ~95 LOC): applicability + four-class catalog + doc-surface coverage rule + operator workflow + Phase 58 changes vs. ad-hoc operator review + future extensions.
- `qor/references/doctrine-shadow-genome-countermeasures.md`: appended `SG-DocSurfaceUncovered-A` codifying documentation-update gap risk class with Phase 57 source incident.
- `qor/references/glossary.md`: 3 new terms (`procedural-fidelity check`, `procedural deviation`, `doc-surface coverage`) all with `home: qor/references/doctrine-procedural-fidelity.md` + `introduced_in_plan: phase58-procedural-fidelity-and-tech-debt-wrapup`.
- `docs/BACKLOG.md`: B23 marked `[x] (v0.44.0 — Complete)`.

**Substantiate-time meta-coherence enforcement**: Step 4.6.6 ran against Phase 58's own seal commit's `files_touched` set — `dist/procedural-fidelity.findings.json` empty (`[]`), EXIT 0. The Phase 58 plan dogfoods its own contract: skill body + script + doctrine + schema-adjacent changes all matched against `docs/SYSTEM_STATE.md` update (12-phase backfill) → at-least-one threshold satisfied → no deviation.

**Tests**: 1202 passing × 2 (deterministic). +27 new Phase 58 tests including AST-anchored substantiate-skill wiring invariant, doctrine round-trip integrity, conftest fixture introspection, glossary round-trip, Phase 59 ideation-rename regression, meta-coherence self-application.

**Reliability sweep**: intent-lock VERIFIED, skill admission ADMITTED, gate-skill matrix 29/112/0, secret-scan EXIT 0, procedural-fidelity EXIT 0, dist 4 variants OK (236 files), badge currency OK.

**Razor compliance**: `procedural_fidelity.py` 190 LOC (under 250 cap); longest function ~22 LOC; max nesting 2; zero nested ternaries.

**Decision**: Phase 58 sealed at v0.44.0. B23 fully closed. Pre-Phase-58 SYSTEM_STATE drift remediated; forward-only invariant enforced. Test pollution structurally prevented. Issue #20 ideation moved to Phase 59 ready for independent implementation. The Phase 57-style "operator caught the doc-surface gap manually" failure mode is now structurally surfaced at substantiate-time via `SG-DocSurfaceUncovered-A` countermeasure.

## Phase 59 (v0.45.0 — 2026-05-02): `/qor-ideate` ideation readiness phase (Issue #20)

Closes Issue #20 (governed ideation readiness phase) by introducing `/qor-ideate` as an optional pre-research SDLC phase. Captures intent and assumptions before they become inferred by downstream agents. Codifies `SG-PrematureSolutioning-A` countermeasure. Advisory-gate posture matching Phase 8: hotfixes MAY skip ideation; `/qor-research` and `/qor-plan` accept either ideation OR research as their prior artifact.

**Phase 1 — Ideation gate-artifact schema**:
- `qor/gates/schema/ideation.schema.json` (NEW): required envelope + 6 required content sections (`spark`, `problem_frame`, `transformation_statement`, `boundaries`, `governance_profile`, `readiness`) + 3 optional (`assumptions`, `options`, `failure_remediation`). Closed enums for `readiness.status`, `governance_profile.risk_grade`, `failure_remediation[].return_phase`.
- `qor/scripts/validate_gate_artifact.py` `PHASES` extended with `"ideation"`.

**Phase 2 — `/qor-ideate` skill + dialogue protocol + gate-chain extension**:
- `qor/skills/sdlc/qor-ideate/SKILL.md` (NEW, ~120 LOC) + `references/dialogue-protocol.md` (NEW, ~150 LOC).
- `qor/scripts/gate_chain.py:_check_ideation_predecessor` recognizes `ideation.json` as a valid prior for `/qor-research` and `/qor-plan`. Backward-compatible.
- `qor/gates/delegation-table.md`: 5 new rows for `qor-ideate` routing.
- `qor/gates/chain.md`: chain visualization extended with `(ideate?)` as optional pre-research phase.
- `qor/skills/meta/qor-help/SKILL.md`: catalog row added.

**Phase 3 — doctrine + glossary + SG + CHANGELOG**:
- `qor/references/doctrine-ideation-readiness.md` (NEW, ~140 LOC): 10-section catalog + readiness scoring model + routing matrix + 8-failure-mode catalog (Premature Solutioning / Language Drift / Assumption Laundering / Scope Seepage / Research Asymmetry / Failure Blindness / Premature Decomposition / Validation Collapse).
- `SG-PrematureSolutioning-A` in `doctrine-shadow-genome-countermeasures.md`.
- 6 new glossary terms.

**Tests**: 1237 passing × 2 (deterministic). +35 new Phase 59 tests. Skill registry: 30 skills (was 29). Handoff matrix: 115 handoffs (was 112; +3 from qor-ideate routes), 0 broken. Dist: 243 files (was 236; +7 for qor-ideate across 4 variants).

**Reliability sweep**: intent-lock VERIFIED, skill admission ADMITTED, gate-skill matrix 30/115/0, dist drift OK, badge currency OK.

**Razor compliance**: zero new `.py` modules; gate_chain.py extension `_check_ideation_predecessor` is 14 LOC. Within bounds.

**Decision**: Phase 59 sealed at v0.45.0. Issue #20 fully closed. Ideation is now a first-class auditable SDLC phase with structural guards against the 8 canonical unraveling points. Advisory-gate posture preserves backward compatibility; existing flows continue to work without ideation.
