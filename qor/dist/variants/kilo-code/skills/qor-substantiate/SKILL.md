## Purpose

The final phase of the S.H.I.E.L.D. lifecycle. Verify that implementation matches the encoded blueprint (Reality = Promise), then cryptographically seal the session.

## Execution Protocol

### Step 0: Gate Check (advisory — Phase 8 wiring)

Verify prior-phase artifact exists and is well-formed before proceeding.

```python
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'qor/scripts')
import gate_chain, session

sid = session.get_or_create()
result = gate_chain.check_prior_artifact("substantiate", session_id=sid)
if not result.found:
    # Prompt user to override; on confirm:
    gate_chain.emit_gate_override(
        current_phase="substantiate",
        prior_phase_name="implement",
        reason="user override: implement.json not found",
        session_id=sid,
    )
elif not result.valid:
    gate_chain.emit_gate_override(
        current_phase="substantiate",
        prior_phase_name="implement",
        reason=f"user override: {result.errors}",
        session_id=sid,
    )
```

Override is permitted (advisory gate) but logged as severity-1 `gate_override` event in the Process Shadow Genome.

### Step 1: Identity Activation
You are now operating as **The QorLogic Judge** in substantiation mode.

Your role is to prove, not to improve. Verify what was built matches what was promised.

### Step 2: State Verification

```
Read: docs/META_LEDGER.md
Read: docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md
Read: .failsafe/governance/AUDIT_REPORT.md
```

**INTERDICTION**: If no PASS verdict exists:
```
ABORT
Report: "Cannot substantiate without PASS verdict. Run /qor-audit first."
```

**INTERDICTION**: If no implementation exists:
```
ABORT
Report: "No implementation found. Run /qor-implement first."
```

### Step 2.5: Version Validation (MANDATORY)

**Verify version consistency** between plan and current state:

```bash
git tag --sort=-v:refname | head -1
```

```
Read: Plan file (docs/Planning/plan-*.md or docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md)
Extract: Target Version from plan header
```

**INTERDICTION**: If Target Version ≤ Current Tag → ABORT (version already shipped).
**INTERDICTION**: If governance files reference wrong version → PAUSE (fix before sealing).

Log: "Version validated: v[current] → v[target] (change type: [hotfix|feature|breaking])"

### Step 3: Reality Audit

Compare implementation against blueprint:

```
Read: All files in src/
Compare: Against docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md file tree
```

Template: `references/qor-substantiate-templates.md`.

**Findings**:
- **MISSING**: Planned but not created -> FAIL
- **UNPLANNED**: Created but not in blueprint -> WARNING (document in ledger)
- **EXISTS**: Matches -> PASS

### Step 3.5: Blocker Verification

Read `docs/BACKLOG.md`. Warn if open Security Blockers or related Development Blockers exist.

### Step 4: Functional Verification

#### Test Audit
```
Glob: tests/**/*.test.{ts,tsx,js}
Read: Test files
```

Template: `references/qor-substantiate-templates.md`.

#### Visual Silence Verification (if frontend)
```
Grep: "color:" in src/**/*.{css,tsx}
Grep: "background:" in src/**/*.{css,tsx}
```

Check for violations:
Template: `references/qor-substantiate-templates.md`.

#### Console.log Artifacts
```
Grep: "console.log" in src/**/*
```

Template: `references/qor-substantiate-templates.md`.

### Step 4.5: Skill File Integrity Check

If any skill files (`.claude/commands/qor-*.md`) were modified during this session:

1. List modified skill files from git diff
2. For each modified skill:
   - Verify it still has required sections: `<skill>` block, `## Execution Protocol`, `### Step Z: Write Gate Artifact (Phase 11D wiring)

Persist the structured gate artifact at `.qor/gates/<session_id>/substantiate.json` so downstream phases can read it via `gate_chain.check_prior_artifact`.

```python
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'qor/scripts')
import gate_chain, shadow_process

# Build payload conforming to qor/gates/schema/substantiate.schema.json
payload = {
    "ts": shadow_process.now_iso(),
    # ... phase-specific required fields (see schema)
}
gate_chain.write_gate_artifact(phase="substantiate", payload=payload, session_id=sid)
```

Schema lives at `qor/gates/schema/substantiate.schema.json`; the helper validates before write.

## Constraints`, `## Next Step`
   - Verify the `## Next Step` section references valid successor skills
   - Log in ledger: "Skill file [name] modified — structure verified"

If any skill is missing required sections after modification:

```
PAUSE
Report: "Skill [name] missing required section: [section]. Fix before sealing."
```

### Step 4.6: Reliability Sweep (Phase 17 wiring)

Three reliability enforcement gates run sequentially. Each is an interdiction: non-zero exit aborts substantiation.

```bash
SESSION_ID=$(cat .qor/session/current 2>/dev/null || echo default)

# Re-verify the intent lock captured at /qor-implement Step 5.5.
# Fails if plan, audit, or HEAD commit drifted since capture.
python qor/reliability/intent-lock.py verify --session "$SESSION_ID" || ABORT

# Verify current skill is registered and frontmatter is well-formed.
python qor/reliability/skill-admission.py qor-substantiate || ABORT

# Verify all /qor-* handoff references across skills resolve to real skills.
python qor/reliability/gate-skill-matrix.py || ABORT
```

Any ABORT leaves the session unsealed. Operator must resolve the drift (re-audit, re-admit, or fix broken handoff) and re-run substantiation.

### Step 5: Section 4 Razor Final Check

Template: `references/qor-substantiate-templates.md`.

### Step 6: Sync System State

Map the final physical tree:

```
Glob: src/**/*
Glob: tests/**/*
Glob: docs/**/*
```

Create/Update `docs/SYSTEM_STATE.md`:

Template: `references/qor-substantiate-templates.md`.

### Step 7: Final Merkle Seal

Calculate session seal:

Reference implementation: `.claude/commands/scripts/calculate-session-seal.py`.

Update `docs/META_LEDGER.md`:

Template: `references/qor-substantiate-templates.md`.

### Step 7.5: Version bump + annotated tag (Phase 13 wiring)

```python
# Phase 13 wiring: bump version + tag (W-3 fix: phase_num derived explicitly)
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'qor/scripts')
import governance_helpers as gh

plan_path = gh.current_phase_plan_path()              # V-5: lexicographic suffix
phase_num, slug = gh.derive_phase_metadata(plan_path) # W-3: derive before use
change_class = gh.parse_change_class(plan_path)       # V-2: bold-form enforced
new_version = gh.bump_version(change_class)           # V-6 + W-4: tag-collision + downgrade interdiction
tag = gh.create_seal_tag(
    new_version, merkle_seal, ledger_entry_num, phase_num, change_class,
)
```

### Step 8: Cleanup Staging

Clear: .failsafe/governance/

Preserve only the final AUDIT_REPORT.md (or archive it).

### Step 9: Final Report

Template: `references/qor-substantiate-templates.md`.

### Step 9.5: Stage Artifacts (for user commit)

  **Stage All Artifacts**:
  ```bash
  git add docs/CONCEPT.md
  git add docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md
  git add docs/META_LEDGER.md
  git add docs/SYSTEM_STATE.md
  git add docs/BACKLOG.md
  git add src/
  ```

  **Next Steps**: Review the staged files and then commit and push when ready.

  Example commit message:
  ```
  seal: [plan-slug] - Session substantiated
  Merkle seal: [chain-hash]
  Verdict: PASS
  Files: [file-count]
  ```

REPORT: "Session committed and pushed to [current-branch]"

### Step 9.6: Push/Merge Options (Phase 13 — 4-option menu)

Prompt user with four options (never offer continuation menus when work is sealable; the next decision is push/merge, not "what next phase"):

1. **Push only** — `git push origin <branch>`.
2. **Push + open PR** — `gh pr create` (description must cite plan file, ledger entry `#<n>`, and Merkle seal hash per `doctrine-governance-enforcement.md` §6).
3. **Merge to main locally (dry-run first)** — `git merge --no-commit --no-ff <branch>`; on conflict, abort and prompt operator.
4. **Hold local** — no push/merge this session.

Annotated tag was already created in Step 7.5; do not re-offer.

Template: `references/qor-substantiate-templates.md`.

## Failure Scenarios

### If Reality != Promise:

Template: `references/qor-substantiate-templates.md`.

## Constraints

- **NEVER** seal a session with Reality != Promise
- **NEVER** skip any verification step
- **NEVER** seal with Section 4 violations present
- **NEVER** seal with version mismatch (Target ≤ Current Tag)
- **ALWAYS** validate version before sealing
- **ALWAYS** update SYSTEM_STATE.md before sealing
- **ALWAYS** calculate proper chain hash
- **ALWAYS** document any unplanned files in ledger
- **ALWAYS** verify chain integrity before sealing

## Success Criteria

Substantiation succeeds when:

- [ ] PASS verdict exists in AUDIT_REPORT.md
- [ ] Version validated (Target > Current Tag)
- [ ] Reality matches Promise (all planned files exist, no missing)
- [ ] Open security blockers reviewed
- [ ] Test audit completed
- [ ] Section 4 Razor final check passed
- [ ] SYSTEM_STATE.md synced with actual file tree
- [ ] Merkle seal calculated and recorded in META_LEDGER
- [ ] Session committed and pushed
- [ ] Merge/PR/tag options presented to user

## Integration with S.H.I.E.L.D.

This skill implements:

- **Session Seal**: Cryptographic proof that Reality matches Promise
- **Version Gate**: Prevents sealing with stale or mismatched versions
- **Reality Audit**: File-by-file comparison against blueprint
- **Hash Chain Finalization**: Calculates session seal for META_LEDGER
