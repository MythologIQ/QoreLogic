## Purpose

Bring surgical precision to debugging. AI coding agents typically pull a thread and watch the codebase unravel — guessing at fixes, introducing regressions, chasing cascading failures. The Fixer enforces a formal methodology: **prove the root cause first, then propose the minimal fix.** No code changes until the cause-effect chain is established with evidence.

## When to Use

- Runtime errors with unclear origin or misleading stack traces
- Non-deterministic failures (works sometimes, fails others)
- Cascading failures after refactoring
- Proactive verification after significant logic changes
- Test failures requiring formal root-cause analysis
- Structural defects blocking phase transitions

## Execution Protocol

### Step 0: Chain position (Phase 8 wiring)

This skill is **cross-cutting** — invokable from implement, substantiate, or validate phases when regression / hallucination / degradation is detected. No prior-phase gate artifact is required.

### Step 1: Describe the Problem

Provide the Fixer with:

- **Symptom**: What is failing? Error message, unexpected behavior, test output.
- **Context**: What changed recently? Which files are involved?
- **Reproduction**: How to trigger the failure (if known).

If invoking proactively (no specific failure), state which files or logic paths were changed.

### Step 2: Two-Phase Agent Dispatch

**Phase 1 — Rapid Root-Cause (qor-fixer)**

Launch the `general` agent (use `subagent_type: "general"`) with the problem description. The fixer runs all four layers (Dijkstra, Hamming/Shannon, Turing/Hopper, Zeller) focused on the REPORTED symptoms. It identifies root causes and proposes fixes.

Apply the proposed fixes.

**Phase 2 — Residual Sweep (qor-fixer, resumed)**

After Phase 1 fixes are applied, launch the `qor-fixer` agent again to:
- Verify the fixes are complete and correct
- Sweep for residual issues introduced or exposed by the fixes
- Check for similar patterns elsewhere in the codebase
- Validate build artifacts match source (dist/out staleness check)

Phase 2 uses the same four-layer methodology but scoped to the FIXED state, not the original symptoms.

### Step 3: Diagnosis & Handoff

The Fixer produces a final diagnosis with:

- Root cause location and explanation
- Cause-effect chain
- Recommended fix with regression risk assessment
- Related issues discovered during analysis

**Handoff rules:**

- Straightforward fix: Fixer proposes exact code changes
- Architectural changes needed: hand off to `/qor-plan` for Governor review
- Implementation ready: hand off to `/qor-implement` for the Specialist
- Test validation needed: hand off to `/qor-substantiate` for the Judge

## Constraints

- **NEVER** apply a fix without completing at least Layers 1-3
- **NEVER** propose a fix that only addresses the symptom
- **NEVER** apply a fix without a corresponding test that proves it (write test first)
- **NEVER** push a fix to CI without running CI-equivalent commands locally (lint, test with same flags)
- **NEVER** push individual fix commits — batch all fixes into one commit
- **NEVER** force-push to shared branches without GR-2 coordination protocol
- **NEVER** leave secrets in code — rotate immediately, rewrite history, then gitignore (GR-1)
- **ALWAYS** distinguish symptom from root cause
- **ALWAYS** check for similar patterns elsewhere in the codebase
- **ALWAYS** document findings with line numbers and evidence
- **ALWAYS** use `subagent_type: "general"` (not `ultimate-debugger`)
- **ALWAYS** write a failing test before applying any fix
- **ALWAYS** run local CI mirror (lint + test with CI flags) before pushing fixes

## Integration with QorLogic

This skill implements:

- **S.H.I.E.L.D. Diagnostic Service**: On-demand across IMPLEMENT, SUBSTANTIATE, and GATE phases
- **Two-Phase Architecture**: Root-cause first, then residual sweep
- **Four-Layer Methodology**: Dijkstra, Hamming/Shannon, Turing/Hopper, Zeller
- **Evidence-Based Fixes**: Every conclusion backed by code evidence
- **Cross-Agent Handoff**: Routes results to appropriate next agent/skill

## Success Criteria

Debug succeeds when:

- [ ] Root cause identified with evidence (not just symptom)
- [ ] Cause-effect chain documented with line numbers
- [ ] Phase 1 fix applied and verified
- [ ] Phase 2 residual sweep completed
- [ ] No regressions introduced by fix
- [ ] Handoff to appropriate next skill provided
