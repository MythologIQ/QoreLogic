## Execution Protocol

### Step 1: Display Command Summary

Present the command table and decision tree below. No file reads required.

### Step 2: Route User

If the user asks about a specific command, direct them to invoke it. If unsure, recommend `/qor-status` first.

## SDLC Chain (research → plan → audit → implement → substantiate → validate)

| Command | Purpose | Typical When |
|---|---|---|
| `/qor-research` | Investigate before planning. Surface conventions, deps, prior art. | Beginning of any non-trivial work; chain start. |
| `/qor-plan` | Author plan-*.md with phases, tests, open questions. | After research; before audit. |
| `/qor-audit` | Adversarial PASS/VETO review. Razor → `/qor-refactor`; Orphan/Macro → `/qor-organize`. | Before any L2/L3 risk implementation. |
| `/qor-implement` | Execute work under KISS constraints after PASS. | After `/qor-audit` PASS. |
| `/qor-refactor` | File-internal logic shape (Section 4). | When audit/implement detects bloat. |
| `/qor-debug` | Root-cause diagnosis (cross-cutting). | Regression / hallucination / degradation. |
| `/qor-substantiate` | Seal session, record Merkle evidence. | End of completed work session. |
| `/qor-validate` | Verify chain integrity + criteria. | Before delivery; on repeat failure → `/qor-remediate`. |
| `/qor-remediate` | Process-level fix (NOT code). Absorbed the retired qor-course-correct skill. | Process Shadow Genome threshold breach or repeat failure. |

## Memory & Meta

| Command | Purpose | Typical When |
|---|---|---|
| `/qor-status` | Diagnose lifecycle stage + next action. | Any time you need current state. |
| `/qor-document` | Author / update governance docs. | Before delivery; doc rot detected. |
| `/qor-organize` | Project-level structure (directory topology). | When audit flags Orphan/Macro; reorganization needed. |
| `/qor-bootstrap` | Initialize QorLogic DNA for a **new workspace**. | First-time setup. NOT for new features. |
| `/qor-help` | This command. | When uncertain. |
| `/qor-repo-audit` | Repo-level audit (separate from per-feature audits). | Before release; audit rotation. |
| `/qor-repo-release` | Release ceremony + tagging. | After validate PASS; when shipping. |
| `/qor-repo-scaffold` | Create new repo from template. | First-time repo creation. |

## Governance

| Command | Purpose | Typical When |
|---|---|---|
| `/qor-shadow-process` | Append a process-failure event to PROCESS_SHADOW_GENOME. | Auto-invoked by override paths; rarely called manually. |
| `/qor-governance-compliance` | Verify workspace governance compliance (root hygiene, sensitive file checks, structure integrity). | Periodic governance audit; before release. |

## Migrated qore-* skills

These skills migrated from the qore-* prefix during the SSoT consolidation; names retain the "qor-" prefix per Phase 7 rename.

| Command | Purpose | Typical When |
|---|---|---|
| `/qor-docs-technical-writing` | Author or revise technical writing under doctrine. | When documentation needs structured authoring. |
| `/qor-meta-log-decision` | Append a structured decision record. | Major decision points; ADR-style logging. |
| `/qor-meta-track-shadow` | Track shadow-genome-style failure patterns at the meta level. | When patterns of failure emerge across cycles. |

## Workflow Bundles (multi-skill orchestration)

| Bundle | Composition | Typical When |
|---|---|---|
| `/qor-deep-audit` | recon (3 phases) + remediate (3 phases) — large, decomposed | Pre-release readiness, absorbing a codebase, comprehensive tech-debt inventory. |
| `/qor-deep-audit-recon` | research subagents → synthesize RESEARCH_BRIEF → 3× verification | Investigation only; ends at brief. |
| `/qor-deep-audit-remediate` | plan → implement → validate (consumes RESEARCH_BRIEF) | Action half; after recon brief is approved. |
| `/qor-onboard-codebase` | research → organize → audit → plan (4 phases, 3 checkpoints) | Inheriting / merging an external codebase. |
| `/qor-process-review-cycle` | shadow-sweep → remediate → audit (3 phases, 2 checkpoints) | Periodic process health check (weekly/monthly/post-incident). |

Bundles honor `qor/gates/workflow-bundles.md` (checkpoints, budgets, decomposition) and `qor/references/doctrine-token-efficiency.md`.

## Quick Decision Tree

```
New workspace?              → /qor-bootstrap
New feature?                → /qor-research → /qor-plan → /qor-audit → /qor-implement
Check state?                → /qor-status
Refactor needed?            → /qor-refactor (file-internal) or /qor-organize (project-level)
Bug / regression?           → /qor-debug
Done with session?          → /qor-substantiate
Process drift?              → /qor-process-review-cycle
Onboarding a codebase?      → /qor-onboard-codebase
Pre-release deep audit?     → /qor-deep-audit (or recon-only first)
Repeat process failures?    → /qor-remediate
```

## Constraints

- **NEVER** execute other skills from within qor-help (display only)
- **ALWAYS** recommend /qor-status when user is uncertain

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Command summary displayed
- [ ] User directed to appropriate next skill

## Integration with S.H.I.E.L.D.

This skill implements:

- **Lifecycle Navigation**: Entry point for discovering available commands
- **Zero-Read Design**: No file reads required, pure reference output
- **Governor Persona**: Routing guidance without execution
