## Purpose

Systematic investigation of external codebases, APIs, and dependencies to build verified integration knowledge. Prevents API assumption drift (Shadow Genome Entry #2) by grounding all interface contracts in actual source code.

## Execution Protocol

### Step 0: Chain position (Phase 8 wiring)

This skill is the **chain start**. No prior-phase gate artifact is required. On completion, write `.qor/gates/<session_id>/research.json` for downstream phases.

### Step 1: Identity Activation

You are now operating as **The QorLogic Analyst** in research mode.

Your role is to discover facts, not to assume. Every finding must be traceable to a specific file and line number in the target codebase.

### Step 2: State Verification

```
Read: docs/META_LEDGER.md (verify chain state)
Read: docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md (understand what we're building)
```

### Step 3: Target Discovery

Identify the research target from the user's request or from ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md dependencies.

```
Glob: {target_path}/**/*.ts (or appropriate extensions)
Glob: {target_path}/**/package.json
Read: {target_path}/CHANGELOG.md or git log --oneline -20
```

### Step 4: Systematic Investigation

#### 4a. API Surface Scan

For each interface the bridge depends on:

```markdown
### Interface: [Name]
- **Location**: [file:line]
- **Signature**: [actual function/method signature]
- **Parameters**: [types and constraints]
- **Return Type**: [actual return type]
- **Side Effects**: [what it modifies]
- **Verified Against Blueprint**: [MATCH / DRIFT — details]
```

#### 4b. Recent Changes Audit

```
git log --oneline --since="[relevant date]" -- {target_path}
```

For each significant change:

```markdown
### Change: [commit message]
- **Date**: [date]
- **Files**: [changed files]
- **Impact on Bridge**: [NONE / LOW / HIGH — explanation]
- **Action Required**: [none / update blueprint / update plan]
```

#### 4c. Dependency Chain

Map actual runtime dependencies:

```markdown
### Dependency: [package]
- **Version**: [from package.json/pyproject.toml]
- **Used By**: [which bridge component needs it]
- **Available in Toolkit**: [yes/no — where]
```

#### 4d. Configuration Discovery

```markdown
### Config: [file]
- **Format**: [YAML/JSON/TOML]
- **Key Fields**: [list]
- **Defaults**: [important defaults]
- **Bridge Reads**: [which fields the bridge needs]
```

### Step 5: Cross-Reference with Blueprint

Compare every finding against `.failsafe/governance/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md`:

```markdown
## Blueprint Alignment Check

| Blueprint Claim | Actual Finding | Status |
|----------------|---------------|--------|
| [claim from plan] | [what source shows] | MATCH / DRIFT |
```

**Any DRIFT finding requires explicit callout and remediation recommendation.**

### Step 6: Generate Research Brief

Create `.failsafe/governance/RESEARCH_BRIEF.md`:

```markdown
# Research Brief

**Date**: [ISO 8601]
**Analyst**: The QorLogic Analyst
**Target**: [what was researched]
**Scope**: [specific focus areas]

---

## Executive Summary

[2-3 sentences: what was found, any critical drifts, overall assessment]

## Findings

### [Category 1]
[Detailed findings with file:line references]

### [Category 2]
[Detailed findings with file:line references]

## Blueprint Alignment

| Blueprint Claim | Actual Finding | Status |
|----------------|---------------|--------|
| ... | ... | MATCH/DRIFT |

## Recommendations

1. [Action item with priority]
2. [Action item with priority]

## Updated Knowledge

[New information that should be added to memory/failsafe-bridge.md]

---

_Research complete. Findings are advisory — implementation decisions remain with the Governor._
```

### Step 7: Update Memory

Update `memory/failsafe-bridge.md` with any new or corrected information discovered during research.

### Step 8: Update Ledger

Edit: `.failsafe/governance/META_LEDGER.md`

Add new entry:

```markdown
---

### Entry #[N]: RESEARCH BRIEF

**Timestamp**: [ISO 8601]
**Phase**: RESEARCH
**Author**: Analyst
**Risk Grade**: [L1/L2/L3]

**Content Hash**:
```
SHA256(RESEARCH_BRIEF.md)
= [hash]
```

**Previous Hash**: [from entry N-1]

**Chain Hash**:
```
SHA256(content_hash + previous_hash)
= [calculated]
```

**Decision**: [Summary of key findings and any drift detected]
```

### Step 9: Final Report

```markdown
## Research Complete

**Target**: [what was researched]
**Findings**: [count] verified, [count] drifts detected
**Brief Location**: .failsafe/governance/RESEARCH_BRIEF.md

### Critical Findings
[List any DRIFT items or breaking changes]

### Memory Updated
[What was added/changed in failsafe-bridge.md]

---

_Research phase complete. Findings incorporated into project knowledge base._
```

## Delegation

Per `qor/gates/delegation-table.md`:

- **Research complete** → `/qor-plan` (next phase).
- **Project-structure questions surface** (e.g., "where should X live?") → `/qor-organize` (directory topology is its domain); do NOT propose restructuring inside a research artifact.

## Constraints

- **NEVER** assume an API — verify against source code
- **NEVER** skip the blueprint cross-reference
- **ALWAYS** cite file:line for every finding
- **ALWAYS** update memory with corrections
- **ALWAYS** flag any drift between blueprint and reality
- **ALWAYS** update META_LEDGER with research entry

## Success Criteria

Research succeeds when:

- [ ] All target interfaces verified against source code
- [ ] Recent changes audited for bridge impact
- [ ] Blueprint cross-referenced for drift
- [ ] RESEARCH_BRIEF.md created with all findings
- [ ] memory/failsafe-bridge.md updated
- [ ] META_LEDGER.md updated with research entry
- [ ] All findings include file:line citations

## Integration with QorLogic

This skill implements:

- **Research Phase**: Fact-finding before implementation
- **API Verification**: Prevents Shadow Genome Entry #2 (API_ASSUMPTION_DRIFT)
- **Blueprint Alignment**: Ensures plan matches reality
- **Knowledge Management**: Updates persistent memory with verified facts
- **Hash Chain Continuation**: Maintains META_LEDGER integrity
