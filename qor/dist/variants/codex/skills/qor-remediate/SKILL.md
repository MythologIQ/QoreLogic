## Purpose

Handle **process-level** failures distinct from code failures:

- Repeated gate overrides
- Threshold breach in Process Shadow Genome (severity sum ≥ 10)
- Regression pattern detected across multiple implement/substantiate cycles
- Capability shortfalls compounding (Codex absent, Agent Teams unavailable)

For **code-level** failures (runtime errors, test failures, broken behavior), use `/qor-debug` instead.

## Execution Protocol

### Step 0: Chain position (Phase 8 wiring)

This skill is **cross-cutting** — invoked when the Process Shadow Genome threshold breaches or by explicit user request. It reads `docs/PROCESS_SHADOW_GENOME.md` directly rather than a prior gate artifact.

### Step 1 — Read context

Invoke `qor/scripts/remediate_read_context.py` via its library interface:

```python
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, 'qor/scripts')
import remediate_read_context as rrc
groups = rrc.load_unaddressed_groups()
```

- Reads both `docs/PROCESS_SHADOW_GENOME.md` (LOCAL) and `docs/PROCESS_SHADOW_GENOME_UPSTREAM.md` via `shadow_process.read_all_events()`.
- Filters `addressed=false`.
- Groups by `(event_type, skill, session_id)`.
- Empty-log case returns `{}`.
- Read latest substantiate gate artifact if present (external to helper).

### Step 2 — Pattern match

Invoke `qor/scripts/remediate_pattern_match.py`:

```python
import remediate_pattern_match as rpm
classifications = rpm.classify(groups)
```

Categorizes each group into one pattern (priority-ordered, highest wins):

- **Aged-high-severity**: sev >= 3 event unaddressed > 90 days (auto-escalated via `qor/scripts/check_shadow_threshold.py`).
- **Hallucination**: unverified mechanism naming caught at substantiate.
- **Regression**: implement-substantiate cycle producing worse state than prior cycle.
- **Gate-loop**: >=2 `gate_override` events in same group (plan-audit, audit-implement). Root cause likely plan-quality or audit-calibration.
- **Capability-shortfall aggregation**: >=3 `capability_shortfall` events in one session.

### Step 3 — Propose process change

Invoke `qor/scripts/remediate_propose.py`:

```python
import remediate_propose as rp
proposals = [rp.propose(c) for c in classifications]
```

Each proposal maps pattern to proposal_kind (`skill | agent | gate | doctrine`) with a skeleton `proposal_text`. Not a code change — a **skill / agent / gate / doctrine** change.

Examples:
- Add a grounding check to `qor-plan` Step 2b for a specific mechanism class
- Tighten `qor-audit` rubric to catch a specific violation class
- Add a reference file under a skill's `references/` capturing a recurring anti-pattern
- Escalate a severity level in the shadow rubric
- Retire a skill that consistently produces low-quality output

### Step 4 — Mark events addressed

Invoke `qor/scripts/remediate_mark_addressed.py`:

```python
import remediate_mark_addressed as rma
flipped, missing = rma.mark_addressed(proposal["addressed_event_ids"], session_id=sid)
```

- Routes write-back to each event's origin file (LOCAL or UPSTREAM) via `shadow_process.id_source_map()` + `write_events_per_source`.
- Returns `(flipped_count, missing_ids)`. `missing_ids` is the list of IDs not found in either log — surfaced per SG-032 instead of silently dropped.
- Writes `addressed: true`, `addressed_ts: <ISO-8601>`, `addressed_reason: "remediated"` (schema enum value; detailed reason is recorded in the gate artifact).

### Step 5 — Emit remediate gate artifact

Invoke `qor/scripts/remediate_emit_gate.py`:

```python
import remediate_emit_gate as reg
path = reg.emit(proposal, session_id=sid)
```

Writes `.qor/gates/<session_id>/remediate.json` with the proposal plus a `ts` field for downstream audit.

## Constraints

- **NEVER** propose code changes — that is `/qor-debug`'s domain
- **NEVER** mark events addressed without a concrete remediation paired to each
- **ALWAYS** cite shadow events by `id` in the remediation proposal
- **ALWAYS** write the gate artifact; remediation that doesn't pass downstream audit is advisory-only until reviewed
- **ALWAYS** check `missing_ids` from `mark_addressed`; non-empty indicates a stale or typo'd event ID and warrants operator attention

## Tested behaviors

See `tests/test_remediate.py` (18 tests): context loading + filtering + grouping, empty-state handling, pattern classification for all 5 patterns, proposal shape + kind mapping + id preservation, mark-addressed flip + origin-file routing + missing-id surfacing, gate artifact write path + payload roundtrip.
