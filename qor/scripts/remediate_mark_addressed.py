"""remediate: two-stage addressed flip (Phase 36, B19).

Phase 36 two-stage contract codified in doctrine-governance-enforcement.md §10.1:

Stage 1 -- ``mark_addressed_pending(ids, session_id)``:
    Flips ``addressed_pending: true`` on the given events. ``addressed`` stays
    ``false`` (and ``addressed_ts``/``addressed_reason`` remain ``null``). This
    signals "remediation proposed; awaiting review." Called from
    ``/qor-remediate`` Step 4.

Stage 2 -- ``mark_addressed(ids, session_id, review_pass_artifact_path,
remediate_gate_path)``:
    Flips ``addressed: true`` + ``addressed_reason: "remediated"`` + stamps
    ``addressed_ts`` ONLY after verifying a PASS audit artifact whose
    ``reviews_remediate_gate`` field references the remediate gate being
    closed. Called from ``/qor-audit`` Step 4 when operator passes the
    ``reviews-remediate:<path>`` skill arg.

On verification failure ``mark_addressed`` raises ``ReviewAttestationError``;
no event is mutated. This is the V1 resolution from Phase 36 Pass 1 audit --
review-pass attestation requires an explicit operator signal (the
``reviews_remediate_gate`` field), not mere file presence.

SG-032 guard: unknown IDs are surfaced in the returned ``missing`` list
rather than silently dropped.
