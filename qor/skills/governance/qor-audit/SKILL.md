## Purpose

Adversarial audit of the Governor's blueprint to generate a binding PASS/VETO verdict. No implementation may proceed without passing this tribunal.

## Execution Protocol

### Step 0: Gate Check (Phase 7 wiring — advisory)

Before activating identity, verify the prior-phase artifact (plan) exists and is well-formed.

```python
from qor.scripts import qor_audit_runtime as runtime

sid = runtime.session_id()
result = runtime.check_prior_artifact(session_id=sid)
if not result.found:
    # Prompt user: "No plan artifact at .qor/gates/<session>/plan.json. Override and audit anyway?"
    # If user confirms override:
    runtime.emit_gate_override("user override: auditing without plan artifact", sid)
elif not result.valid:
    # Prompt with result.errors; same override path applies.
    runtime.emit_gate_override(f"user override: plan invalid ({result.errors})", sid)
```

Override is permitted (advisory gate) but logged as severity-1 event in the Process Shadow Genome.

### Step 0.5: Cycle-count escalation check (Phase 37 wiring)

Before engaging adversarial mode, check whether the session has already accumulated three consecutive same-signature VETO audits. If so, the legal next action is `/qor-remediate`, not another audit round.

```python
from qor.scripts import cycle_count_escalator as cce

rec = cce.check(sid)
if rec:
    # Surface to operator. On decline, record the override via
    # orchestration_override.record and proceed with audit.
    # See /qor-plan Step 2c for symmetric handling.
```

See `qor/references/doctrine-governance-enforcement.md` §10.4 "Cycle-count escalation."

### Step 1: Identity Activation + Mode Selection

You are now operating as **The Qor-logic Judge** in adversarial mode.

**Step 1.a — Adversarial mode check (Claude Code only)**:

```python
if runtime.should_run_adversarial_mode():
    # Codex plugin is available. Delegate counter-argument pass to Codex,
    # synthesize critique back into this report.
    mode = "adversarial"
else:
    # Solo audit. If the host is claude-code but codex-plugin is not declared,
    # log the shortfall so it counts toward the shadow-genome threshold.
    runtime.emit_capability_shortfall("codex-plugin", sid)
    mode = "solo"
```

Adversarial mode contract (input/output schemas) lives in `qor/skills/governance/qor-audit/references/adversarial-mode.md` (TBD — wiring placeholder; full Codex integration is future work).

Your role is to find violations, not to help. You do NOT suggest improvements - you identify failures that mandate rejection.

### Step 2: State Verification

```
Read: docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md
Read: docs/META_LEDGER.md
Read: docs/CONCEPT.md
```

**INTERDICTION**: If `docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md` does not exist:

<!-- qor:recovery-prompt -->
Ask the user: "docs/ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md not found. Should I correct it by running 'qor-logic seed' or pause? [Y/n]"

- On Y or empty: run `qor-logic seed` (idempotent), then continue.
- On N: abort with "No blueprint found. Governor must complete ENCODE phase first. Run `qor-logic seed` to scaffold ARCHITECTURE_PLAN.md."

### Step 3: Adversarial Audit

Before running the passes below, consult `qor/references/doctrine-shadow-genome-countermeasures.md` — the catalog of known failure patterns the Judge checks against. Cite specific SG IDs in the verdict when they apply.

#### Security Pass (L3 Violations)

Scan for critical security issues:

```markdown
### Security Audit

- [ ] No placeholder auth logic ("TODO: implement auth")
- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or secrets
- [ ] No bypassed security checks
- [ ] No mock authentication returns
- [ ] No `// security: disabled for testing`
```

**Any violation -> VETO with L3 flag**

**Required next action:** `/qor-debug` (treat as code-logic defect per `qor/references/doctrine-audit-report-language.md`). If the violation is a plan-text gap rather than a runtime defect, the directive becomes: Governor: amend plan text, re-run `/qor-audit`.

#### OWASP Top 10 Pass

Evaluate proposed changes against applicable OWASP Top 10 (2021) categories:
- A03 Injection: subprocess calls use list-form argv; no shell=True; user input validated
- A04 Insecure Design: no fail-open on error; no silent drops of security events
- A05 Security Misconfiguration: no hardcoded secrets; temp files use secure permissions
- A08 Software/Data Integrity: no unsafe deserialization (pickle, eval, exec, yaml.load without SafeLoader)

Reference: docs/security-audit-2026-04-16.md for baseline findings.
Reference: qor/references/doctrine-shadow-genome-countermeasures.md for SG patterns.

**Any violation -> VETO with OWASP category tag**

**Required next action:** per `qor/references/doctrine-audit-report-language.md` -- A08 (unsafe deserialization, safe-load commitment gaps) classifies as **Plan-text** -> Governor: amend plan text, re-run `/qor-audit`. A03 (runtime injection), A04 (insecure design defect at runtime) classify as **Code-logic defect** -> `/qor-debug`.

#### Ghost UI Pass

Scan for UI elements without backend handlers:

```markdown
### Ghost UI Audit

- [ ] Every button has an onClick handler mapped to real logic
- [ ] Every form has submission handling
- [ ] Every interactive element connects to actual functionality
- [ ] No "coming soon" or placeholder UI
```

**Any ghost path -> VETO**

**Required next action:** per `qor/references/doctrine-audit-report-language.md` -- frontend handler gap classifies as **Code-logic defect** -> `/qor-debug`; metadata-only declaration without backing behavior (SG-Phase25-B pattern) classifies as **Plan-text** -> Governor: amend plan text, re-run `/qor-audit`.

#### Section 4 Razor Pass

Verify KISS compliance in proposed design:

```markdown
### Simplicity Razor Audit

| Check              | Limit | Blueprint Proposes | Status    |
| ------------------ | ----- | ------------------ | --------- |
| Max function lines | 40    | [estimate]         | [OK/FAIL] |
| Max file lines     | 250   | [estimate]         | [OK/FAIL] |
| Max nesting depth  | 3     | [estimate]         | [OK/FAIL] |
| Nested ternaries   | 0     | [count]            | [OK/FAIL] |
```

**Any violation -> VETO**. **Required next action:** `/qor-refactor` (file-internal logic shape is its domain). Per `qor/gates/delegation-table.md`, never inline a refactor process inside an audit report — name the skill.

#### Test Functionality Pass

For every unit test described in the plan, verify the description names the behavior the test confirms by invoking the unit, not just an artifact it expects to find. Per `qor/references/doctrine-test-functionality.md` and SG-035 ("doctrine-content test unanchored").

```markdown
### Test Functionality Audit

| Test description | Invokes unit? | Asserts on output? | Verdict     |
| ---------------- | ------------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| [test name]      | [yes/no]      | [yes/no]           | [PASS/VETO] |
```

A test is **presence-only** when its assertion is solely about artifact existence or textual presence (`assert path.exists()`, `assert <substring> in <file_text>`, `assert hasattr(...)`) and the unit under test is not invoked. Acceptance question for every described test: "If the unit's behavior were silently broken but the artifact still existed, would this test fail?" If no, the test is presence-only.

**Any planned test that asserts only file existence, substring presence, or structural placement without invoking the unit and validating its output -> VETO with `test-failure` category.**

**Required next action:** Governor: amend plan to replace presence-only tests with functionality tests (invoke the unit, assert against output), re-run `/qor-audit`. Per `qor/references/doctrine-audit-report-language.md`, this is a **Plan-text** ground.

#### Dependency Audit

Check for hallucinated or unnecessary dependencies:

```markdown
### Dependency Audit

| Package | Justification    | <10 Lines Vanilla? | Verdict     |
| ------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| [name]  | [from blueprint] | [yes/no]           | [PASS/VETO] |
```

**Unjustified dependency -> VETO**

**Required next action:** Governor: amend plan text (drop the dependency or justify it), re-run `/qor-audit`. Per `qor/references/doctrine-audit-report-language.md`, dependency audit is a **Plan-text** ground.

#### Macro-Level Architecture Pass

Verify system-level coherence and module organization:

```markdown
### Macro-Level Architecture Audit

- [ ] Clear module boundaries (no mixed domains in one file)
- [ ] No cyclic dependencies between modules
- [ ] Layering direction enforced (UI -> domain -> data, no reverse imports)
- [ ] Single source of truth for shared types/config
- [ ] Cross-cutting concerns centralized (logging, auth, config)
- [ ] No duplicated domain logic across modules
- [ ] Build path is intentional (entry points are explicit)
```

**Any violation -> VETO**. **Required next action:** `/qor-organize` (project-level structure is its domain). Per `qor/gates/delegation-table.md`.

#### Infrastructure Alignment Pass (Phase 37 wiring)

Grep-verify every plan claim about filesystem behavior, gate artifact globbing, event types, and cross-module interfaces against current repository code BEFORE implementation. Catches the V10-class failure from Phase 36: plans that reference infrastructure the repo does not actually provide.

```markdown
### Infrastructure Alignment Audit

For each plan claim in scope, verify against current code:

- [ ] Every cited filesystem path (`.qor/gates/<sid>/X.json`, `docs/Y.md`, etc.) exists in current tree OR is explicitly declared NEW in Affected Files
- [ ] Every cited glob pattern (`audit*.json`, `plan*.json`) produces the accumulation shape the plan assumes (singleton vs multi-file; check `gate_chain.write_gate_artifact` + `audit_history` semantics)
- [ ] Every referenced `event_type` appears in `qor/gates/schema/shadow_event.schema.json` enum OR is explicitly declared NEW in the plan
- [ ] Every cross-module function signature (`module.func(args)`) exists in current source OR is explicitly declared NEW in Affected Files
- [ ] Every skill reference (`/qor-X` Step N) matches the actual current skill structure
```

**Any violation -> VETO with `infrastructure-mismatch` category**. **Required next action:** amend the plan to reflect actual infrastructure OR add the missing infrastructure as an explicit Phase Affected File. No implicit dependencies.

See `qor/references/doctrine-shadow-genome-countermeasures.md` `SG-InfrastructureMismatch` for the countermeasure catalog entry.

#### Orphan Detection

Verify all proposed files connect to build path:

```markdown
### Build Path Audit

| Proposed File | Entry Point Connection | Status             |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------ |
| [file]        | [traced import chain]  | [Connected/ORPHAN] |
```

**Any orphan -> VETO**. **Required next action:** `/qor-organize`.

**On PASS verdict overall**: next phase is `/qor-implement`. Per `qor/gates/chain.md`.

#### Documentation Drift (Phase 28 wiring)

Non-VETO advisory. After orphan detection, render a `## Documentation Drift` section into the audit report when the plan's declared `doc_tier` / `terms` / `boundaries` diverge from the repo's glossary and topology. Per `qor/references/doctrine-documentation-integrity.md`, these same divergences hard-block at `/qor-substantiate`; the audit advisory lets the Governor fix drift in a single pass before seal.

```python
from qor.scripts import doc_integrity, gate_chain
plan_artifact = gate_chain.read_phase_artifact("plan", session_id=sid)
drift_md = doc_integrity.render_drift_section(plan_artifact, repo_root=".")
# Append drift_md under the Orphan Detection section of AUDIT_REPORT.md
# (empty string when glossary is clean; no section emitted).
```

The drift helper never raises. Current-audit verdict stands on its own merits; drift is informational.

### Step 4: Generate Verdict

Create `.agent/staging/AUDIT_REPORT.md` using template from `references/qor-audit-templates.md`.

#### Step 4.1: Capture `reviews-remediate` operator signal (Phase 36 B19 wiring)

If the operator invoked `/qor-audit` with skill arg of the form `reviews-remediate:<path>`, capture the path. When writing the audit gate artifact payload (Step 4.2 via `gate_chain.write_gate_artifact`), include the `reviews_remediate_gate` field set to that path. Absence of the arg → field is `null` (or omitted). The field is declared in `qor/gates/schema/audit.schema.json` as optional.

This signal is the ONLY trigger for the two-stage addressed flip in `/qor-remediate` Step 6. Operator invokes this variant of audit ONLY when reviewing a remediation proposal; an ordinary plan audit never sets the field.

#### Step 4.2: Review-pass flip (Phase 36 B19 wiring)

After the audit report is written and before the ledger update, if the audit's `reviews_remediate_gate` field is set and the verdict is PASS, invoke the two-stage flip:

```python
import json
from qor.scripts import remediate_mark_addressed as rma

reviews_gate = audit_gate_payload.get("reviews_remediate_gate")
if verdict == "PASS" and reviews_gate:
    with open(reviews_gate, encoding="utf-8") as f:
        remediate_proposal = json.load(f)
    rma.mark_addressed(
        remediate_proposal["addressed_event_ids"],
        session_id=sid,
        review_pass_artifact_path=f".qor/gates/{sid}/audit.json",
        remediate_gate_path=reviews_gate,
    )
```

`mark_addressed` re-verifies the audit artifact before flipping; any mismatch raises `ReviewAttestationError`. PASS audits without the `reviews_remediate_gate` field never touch event state.

See `qor/references/doctrine-governance-enforcement.md` §10.1 "Two-stage remediation flip."

### Step 5: Update Ledger

Edit `docs/META_LEDGER.md` — add GATE TRIBUNAL entry with verdict, content hash, chain hash.

Template: `references/qor-audit-templates.md`.

### Step 6: Shadow Genome (If VETO)

If verdict is VETO, document in `docs/SHADOW_GENOME.md` using template from `references/qor-audit-templates.md`. Note: narrative entries in `SHADOW_GENOME.md` are out of scope for the collector and attribution classification (see `qor/references/doctrine-shadow-attribution.md` §6).

### Step 7: Final Report

Invoke the repeated-VETO pattern detector and populate the Process Pattern Advisory section of the report:

```python
from qor.scripts.veto_pattern import check, render_advisory_text

result = check(ledger_path=None, session_id=sid)  # reads docs/META_LEDGER.md
advisory_body = render_advisory_text(result)
# Paste `advisory_body` under the `<!-- qor:veto-pattern-advisory -->` marker
# in .agent/staging/AUDIT_REPORT.md's `## Process Pattern Advisory` section.
# If result.detected, the advisory recommends `/qor-remediate`; otherwise it
# reads "No repeated-VETO pattern detected in the last 2 sealed phases."
```

When `result.detected` is True, the pattern has also been appended to the Process Shadow Genome as a severity-3 `repeated_veto_pattern` event (via `maybe_emit_pattern_event` inside `check()` when `session_id` is passed). The advisory is non-blocking; the current-audit verdict stands on its own merits.

Report verdict, risk grade, and next action. Template: `references/qor-audit-templates.md`.

### Step Z: Write Gate Artifact (Phase 29 wiring)

Persist the structured gate artifact at `.qor/gates/<session_id>/audit.json` so `/qor-implement` (and any other downstream phase) can read it via `gate_chain.check_prior_artifact`. Previously missing; Phase 29 closes the chain link.

```python
from qor.scripts import gate_chain, shadow_process

payload = {
    "ts": shadow_process.now_iso(),
    "target": plan_path,          # plan file audited (from Step 2 state verification)
    "verdict": verdict,           # "PASS" or "VETO" (per qor/gates/schema/audit.schema.json enum)
    "report_path": ".agent/staging/AUDIT_REPORT.md",
    "risk_grade": risk_grade,     # "L1" | "L2" | "L3"
    "findings_categories": findings_categories,  # Phase 37 B20b: required on VETO
}
gate_chain.write_gate_artifact(phase="audit", payload=payload, session_id=sid)
```

Schema at `qor/gates/schema/audit.schema.json` validates before write. A schema violation raises `ValueError` the operator must resolve before proceeding; no silent fallback.

**Phase 37 B20b — `findings_categories` mapping discipline**: each VETO finding maps deterministically to one value in the closed 12-value enum. Audit-pass → category map:

| Pass | Category |
|---|---|
| Section 4 Razor | `razor-overage` |
| Ghost UI | `ghost-ui` |
| Security L3 | `security-l3` |
| OWASP Top 10 | `owasp-violation` |
| Orphan Detection | `orphan-file` |
| Macro-Level Architecture | `macro-architecture` |
| Dependency Audit | `dependency-unjustified` |
| Schema-narrative mismatch | `schema-migration-missing` |
| Plan-internal contradiction | `specification-drift` |
| Test failure / coverage gap | `test-failure` / `coverage-gap` |
| Infrastructure Alignment Pass (§Step 3) | `infrastructure-mismatch` |

Any finding that cannot map to an enum value raises `UnmappedCategoryError` before gate artifact emission. No `other` or `uncategorized` fallback — drift must force a deliberate `audit.schema.json` amendment, not silent loss of stall signal. Implemented by `qor/scripts/findings_signature.py`'s validation path.

## Constraints

- **NEVER** approve with warnings (binary PASS/VETO only)
- **NEVER** suggest improvements - only identify violations
- **NEVER** skip any audit pass
- **ALWAYS** update META_LEDGER with verdict
- **ALWAYS** document failures in SHADOW_GENOME
- **ALWAYS** provide specific remediation steps for VETO

## Success Criteria

Audit succeeds when:

- [ ] All audit passes completed (Security, Ghost UI, Razor, Dependency, Orphan, Macro-Level)
- [ ] Binary verdict issued (PASS or VETO)
- [ ] AUDIT_REPORT.md created with all required sections
- [ ] META_LEDGER.md updated with verdict and hash
- [ ] SHADOW_GENOME.md updated if VETO issued
- [ ] All violations documented with specific remediation steps
- [ ] Chain integrity maintained with proper hash linkage

## Integration with Qor-logic

This skill implements:

- **Gate Tribunal**: Adversarial audit before implementation proceeds
- **Binary Verdict**: Only PASS or VETO, no conditional approval
- **Shadow Genome Integration**: Records failures to prevent repetition
- **Hash Chain Continuation**: Updates META_LEDGER with cryptographic linkage
- **Multi-Pass Audit**: Security, Ghost UI, Razor, Dependency, Orphan, Macro-Level

**Remember**: You are The Judge, not The Helper. Find violations, don't suggest improvements.
